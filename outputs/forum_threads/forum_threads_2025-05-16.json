It could simply mean that they've removed it from their publishing schedule, not that they've lost publishing rights.  The game is still listed on their website and available for purchase (link below).  In fairness, right to sell and right to publish are not necessarily the same thing.  But perhaps a more salient big picture view here is that is that, if they are still sitting on leftover stock from their last print run, it wouldn't bode well for a premium/anniversary edition.

I got into the hobby around 2016, and literally everyone back then was talking about how great this game is with the hard-to-find expansion. I didn’t buy the 2018 edition because I didn’t want to own the game if the expansion wasn’t going to be reprinted. I played it a couple of times, and it was just OK—never felt like I needed to own it, even though I like the series it’s based on. Never had the chance to tryout the grail expansion and the game totally faded from the discourse. <br/><br/>I wonder what would’ve happened if they had actually included the expansion in the 2018 print. I think this game, along with FFG’s Anniversary Edition of Knizia’s Lord of the Rings game, are some of the biggest missed opportunities for breathing new life into older titles."

While technically Viticulture and Pillars do this differently, I always felt like Pillars did the multi-use thing first, and did it better.  Realistically, what I think Viticulture did was make better use of multi-deck combo building.  Arguably Agricola also did that first and did it better, but I think Viticulture is a more approachable game.  But to your point, Pillars was genuinely doing something unique during the era it was released.  However, specific to when you got into the hobby, worker placement was the hot mechanic from probably 2012-2015 and I think a fair number of games managed to ride that wave for a couple of years beyond.  But if you came into the hobby in 2016, you were coming in when that wave was dying and also when designers were starting to get a better grasp how to meld Ameritrash and Euro mechanics together in a satisfying way (e.g. Great Western Trail, Grand Austria Hotel).  Euro games now days are expected to have a wide space in terms of variable setup and be blended with some other mechanic (i.e. \"pure\" worker placements are uncommon anymore).  Pillars doesn't really compete by these metrics, so I can understand why its fallen out of favor.  But on the other hand, if you compare it to its contemporaries, I think its fair to say that it was somewhat ahead of its time by those same metrics.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how adding the expansion to the reprint would have helped.  The extra abilities are nice, but they're only meant to be used in a 5 or 6 player game.  The board feels too open if you use the expansion with 2 or 3 players.  Playing it with 4 is a bit iffy IMHO.  I don't think adding that it would sell players who dislike the variable turn order mechanic and, being brutally honest, the metal resource has balance problems and I think some rule changes to fix that might have been more prudent."

            "body": "<u>Intro to these “overviews before rules” I do:</u><br/>The goal is to make reading rules easier, for those who want to spend the time. Sounds weird? I'll try to explain...<br/>I love a variety of games but I find there’s an issue with rulebooks. A catch 22 if you will.<br/>Rulebooks (and rule teaches) must be exact, but that creates a lot of time a feeling of anxiety for people as they start reading and wondering “When will it all tie together for me?”, “when will I say ‘ok, THAT’S the game!’?”. Some rulebooks aren’t read or understood because of that, and it’s a shame as many times the game is simpler than was considered.<br/>To prevent that anxiety you need an overview which tells the story of the game (be it in written or video format). You tell a story differently than the way someone explains exact rules. The problem is that rulebooks cannot contain such an overview as it will make them too long, or feel like you’re reading rules twice – hence the catch. But some people do want to spend a few minutes to get the fuller overview of the game, and then dive into the actual rules.<br/>So this is what I did here - a separate thing that comes \"before reading rules\". I would’ve preferred to do this as a video, but right now it’s a high quality youtube channel venture I wasn’t able to raise on my own (in high enough quality). I hope at some point I will move to video format.<br/>And again, it’s an overview, so the decision whether or not to be exact in details or stay in high level is only determined if I felt, from my experience, that it contributed to the ease of reading the rules after reading this overview and how much clearer they became<br/><br/><b><i><u>Pillars of the Earth</u></i></b><br/><br/>The goal is to finish the game with the most points after 6 rounds.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, you will have “craftsmen” cards that basically convert resources to points. Every player starts with 3 of them, and a maximum of 5 at any given time so as they get more, existing ones will be discarded. <br/><br/><b>About workers and master builders</b><br/>It’s a worker placement game but every player has 2 separate groups of figures. What the rules call \"workers\", but also 3 master builders. The master builders are the actual “workers” in terms of the worker-placement mechanism, and the other workers might be viewed more as a resource – so I’ll refer to them as meeples to avoid confusion.<br/><br/><b>Every round has 3 major parts:</b><br/>-\tPlayers draft cards from 9 available ones. 2 of them are those craftsmen cards which have a cost and the others are cards that will allow getting resources later but also require you to send meeples to specific locations in the board (so you can’t take a card if you don’t have enough).<br/>-\tThere’s an interesting way to determine the order of the placement, but in the end, all players will have placed the master builders in different locations in the board.<br/>Players need to notice they need to place a builder in locations where they sent the meeples in the previous phase to get the resources.<br/>-\tAll locations in the board are activated in order – they are numbered from 1-14.<br/><br/><b>Master builder placement phase:</b><br/>How does the “master builder placement” phase done and how is order determined?<br/>There’s a track going from 7 to 0. All master builders are mixed in a bag and pulled up one by one. The owners of the first 7 builders drawn will need to pay money if they want to place it right there and then on a location (once a location is occupied, then in general, it is blocked for other players). The price keeps dropping as more builders are drawn from 7 until it reaches 0 and then they are just placed.<br/>However – if there's still a price to place the builder (the first 7 drawn), players can opt to pass. That means that master builder will wait in line until all master builders have been pulled from the bag, and only then it will be placed (for free), in the same order different players have passed. <br/><br/><b>What are the various numbered locations?</b><br/><i>Locations #1 and #2</i> are together (as the #1 location isn’t really a worker placement location) – A card is drawn, it’s usually a negative effect. A player who placed a builder on the #2 location can choose to disregard the card or get a bonus resource.<br/><br/><i>Location #3</i> provides money according to the meeples you didn’t send out during the initial card phase.<br/><br/><i>Location #4</i> has two action cards (allowing placing 2 master builders) and you will get the card. It can be an immediate effect card, and ongoing effect or something you can trigger later.<br/><br/><i>Location #5</i> gives victory points (2 master builders can be placed there – the first one will get more points)<br/><br/><i>Location #6, 7 and 8</i> are resource locations – You get the promised resources from the cards you chose (and paid for by sending meeples).<br/><br/><i>Location #9</i> allows everyone to place master builders there – The first one to place it will get a rare metal resource, and any player who didn’t place there at all will need to pay taxes according to a dice roll.<br/><br/><i>Location #10</i> has two craftsmen cards allowing placing 2 builders – You get the card you placed next to, for free this time.<br/><br/><i>Location #11</i> provides 2 temporary meeples for next round.<br/><br/><i>Location #12</i> has a market with 4 of each regular resource and you can place up to 4 master builders there (even your own again) – According to placement order (and round and round again) you choose if to buy a single type of resource from the market, sell a single type of resource (to the bank), or pass and be done with this location altogether. You can sell metal here, but not buy one.<br/><br/><i>Location #13</i> doesn’t require placing master builders. It finally allows you to use your craftsmen cards to gain points from resources (each card provides a conversion rate but you cannot use it only a certain number of times). In the game’s arc you are contributing to building a cathedral (similarly to the story of the Ken Follet book “Pillars of the Earth”).<br/><br/><i>Location #14</i> gives the person who placed there his master builder the “first player” instead of the next person clockwise. The first player gets to draft cards first early in the round.<br/><br/>And that’s it… the game ends after the 6th round – tracked by placing six 3D cathedral pieces.<br/>"

This classic of the worker placement genre is inspired by the book of the same title, and pits a few craftsmen against each other in the joint work of building one central construction project. Any products which contribute to the final build reward victory points and the most points at the end wins. <br/><br/>\tThe innovation here comes from the unique turn order mechanism, which allows players to go early, but pay more for the privilege, or go late for free or cheap.  Then once all workers are in position the spaces resolve in a pre-determined  order. Funnily in this game in addition to workers for action selection, the players also have laborer pieces that can be sent out to gather resources of various types (wood, steel, stone, etc) in a less limited form than traditional worker placement. <br/><br/>\tThe randomized event deck and the semi-random order in which the main production cards come out and are bid for provide plenty of variability to keep the game from being easily solvable. The market where you can buy and sell extra resources provides that extra little bit of consistency so you can usually get something done even if your preferred options aren't available during the main worker placement phase.<br/><br/>\tAll in all it is a solid introduction to the genre on a beautifully illustrated board. The pieces are delightfully unique and the rules are simple enough to introduce to new gamers (it was literally my first worker placement game) but it adds enough freshness to keep you coming back for more.

            "body": "So we're saying roughly £100 per set, £226 for both + Mothra, and £286 for everything plus the luxury bonuses.<br/>Wow. That's about a third more than I expected. On top of that there's a whole lot more FOMO than I was expecting, what with Mothra being a KS exclusive and the text of the campaign itself casting doubt over retail availability.<br/>There was a post in the Unmatched subreddit discussing this where pretty much everybody participating voiced that the price tag was simply too high. A couple of these Redditors also pointed out that the high price tag effectively leads to non-American backers subsidising RG for the US tariffs given their pledge not to ever ask for extra funds from backers as a means to mitigate the tariffs effects. (This was a factor I absolutely had not considered as I had - maybe naively? - read RG's statement on the matter as altruistic).<br/><br/>Determining value for money in gaming (both video and tabletop) has arguably always been weird. In the past, for me to go in on a game costing over £100, it's gotta have extremely nice components, be very fun and provide a truly earthshaking experience (TI4 and those four letter Cole Werhle games fit this bill.) Granted I indulge in the Arkham Horror lcg which, as a \"lifestyle\" game has cost way more in the long run, but the experience and variety do enough to justify the costs in such \"lifestyle\" games (see also Warhammer, etc). I wouldn't call Unmatched a \"lifestyle\" game, but I'd say the same applies and I've certainly had my satisfaction out of my UM collection and feel it's money well spent. <br/><br/>So to the game at hand: is the Battle Monsters big bundle - which costs twice as much as Twilight Imperium + Prophecy of Kings - worthy enough of such a price tag? <br/>There are five titans, four factions and four battlegrounds. Is that likely to provide enough variety to entertain for many years? Seems like less variety than either TR:V or Unmatched for multiple times the price... I think the real answer to this relies on tactical/strategic depth, but then how much room for that is there in a game of this type? It's not really like the OG Battle Masters was particularly deep in practice, maybe even less so than Risk...<br/>How do you think the component count and quality for the price look to be stacking up to similar but cheaper RG ventures like Dark Tower and Thunder Road?<br/><br/>If you are a backer, how much did love of Battle Masters or Godzilla influence your decision? My deep and longstanding love of both is what keeps me on the precipice... If it was Heisei-era Godzilla & co, there would be no hesitation on my end at all (I don't think the Monsterverse will or can ever be as iconic as Showa or Heisei era Toho kaiju).<br/><br/>If you're outside of the US, how do you feel about RG's aforementioned pledge and the notion of non-US backers subsidizing US tariffs with increased prices? I don't feel like I'm economically literate enough to come to a conclusion on that matter.  <br/><br/>Apologies if this post reads as muddled. I've got a LOT of complicated feelings about this right now and am very keen to see others' thoughts. Honestly I was hoping someone else would start this conversation as I'm a bit of a RG fanboy at this point...<br/><br/><br/>"

Also the \"one shipping costs + VAT\" even if you buy only one small piece or all forces you to the more expensive pledges, \"because of value\".

But that doesn't matter - people are going to compare what they're getting to other games in the same price range.<br/><br/>I also find it frustrating that they have a cheaper \"gameplay all-in\" level, but then locked additional gameplay content in the cosmetic upgrade packs that they keep insisting are optional. And that the only level with the advertised 30% discount forces you to buy unnecessary card sleeves and leather dice trays that basically mean you're not getting a discount at all and just getting items you don't want for free.<br/><br/>But it's funded, and around 1000 people so far think it's worth it.

I also think it’s bananas to charge people for “deluxe” components when the game is priced in for deluxe already. And the textured bases being extra $$ is the funniest thing I’ve seen on kickstarter in a long time. <br/><br/>RG is going to lose out on a lot of backers because of the price so this game will probably not be further supported after this initial kickstarter.

However, in defense of RG, if you analyze basically any KS project involving delivery of a physical product, you will most certainly find that <i>somebody</i> is subsidizing someone else on shipping/VAT one way or another.  Most notably, in RG's most recent KS campaign before this one, US backers were substantially subsidizing EU backers -- shipping to the US was $10 while shipping + VAT to the EU was $20, which means there was a large subsidy for VAT built into the game's price since the pledge itself was $80 and VAT is also charged on shipping."

And folks are welcome to disagree with the choices we made, e.g., how big the Titans are. But I want to clarify two things.<br/><br/>First, non-US backers are not subsidizing tariffs. Period. The impact of tariffs at the time this is produced will be on how bit the print run is and if it makes it to hobby distribution. At 30%, yes. At 145%, no. As Stephen noted, there are really two choices when you're doing a campaign. You can either charge actual costs at the time of shipping or estimate and provide a flat rate. We prefer the latter so that our backers are never surprised by a second bill down the road.<br/><br/>Second, as I've stated in other places, every single publisher is setting their MSRP based on what the thing costs to make. If you're getting \"more\" in a game that has a lower MSRP, that's because what you are getting costs less to make. There's a secondary piece to that in a KS campaign that offers higher margins than distribution. So you might lower your price to backers against the MSRP or you might subsidize the shipping or through in bennies or whatever. But, at the end of the day, the price is a pretty standard multiplier of the cost. If, for example, CMON is giving you \"more\" in their Marvel United campaign at a cheaper price, either the \"more\" doesn't cost as much or they're charging more for shipping, or maybe they're getting better economies of scale on a title that is well proven, or whatever.<br/><br/>Like I said, I won't begrudge anyone for feeling the game isn't worth the price for them. Everybody has to make that choice for themselves with any game or any other purchase for that matter.

I think threads like this can derail at times from the inital purpose. For me, I felt it was nice to see others who got sticker shock like I did. <br/>I made a reference to Tokyo Clash in my previous post. <br/>If this game was produced to that scale, but added modular terrain, I feel that would drive the price point down and people would be happier to back. <br/>So, yes.

But not like anyone has received a raise that adequately covers cost of living and rent increases. Grocery prices skyrocketed after COVID and when tarrif increases hit the general market I highly doubt prices will go back down after negotiations are reached. It's unfortunate but I foresee both the video game and board game industry shrinking heavily due to out pricing customers that used to be able to easily afford these hobbies. People's wallets are about to get a whole lot tighter. Wages have been super stagnant in the US for a long time."

You probably won’t have a competitive army unless you spend time studying or spend even more to go outside of starter sets. The components won’t be nearly as nice as here (forget about dual layer), you get 2 factions instead of 5, and you won’t have the full rule set or personal dice sets. Sorry, but 40K is going to cost you a lot more time and money with less value over time…<br/>"

So what's it missing? <br/><br/>I think the biggest thing it's missing is the thing that made Battle Masters special: <b>how </b>the \"unique\" units worked. One of the special things in Battle Masters was the cannon being completely different mechanically from the Ogre (and from all other units). I understand it's probably a move to modern design with rage and energy system and unique abilities in there which gives a player more agency.

Just the few things above that I think loses some of that \"Battle Masters\" flavor. Also, I understand why the board isn't a giant mat, but that will be missed too. Lastly, part of the problem is because there's so many changes especially with the complexity in the larger monsters with energy, rage system, resource tokens, etc, that the game really does seem like an entirely new product or idea rather than a refinement (or restoration) of an older game.

I can say that, because we considered them sincerely in development. The special units are a bit more asymmetric than it might seem. Godzilla is the only Titan with special tiles to upgrade his commands. King Ghidorah is the only Titan with rubble tiles he can throw around the board to change the terrain and deal damage. Mechagodzilla has a cool little arsenal system. Kong's big thing is mobility and his ability to gather resources. (He's the smart one, natch.)<br/><br/>We looked real hard at 3D terrain. Ultimately, this project just proved to be so challenging across so many vectors we thought it might be biting off more than we could chew. That said, we're going to be working with Jett from Adrena Creative to do some officially licensed 3D treatments. He did such an amazing job on the 3D bits for Thunder Road: Vendetta."

            "body": "Hey everybody, let’s get the formalities out of the way, this is Manny Vega the designer of <i>Flamecraft</i> and <i>Flamecraft Duals</i>. I’m not usually out at the front of the Kickstarter campaigns, preferring to sit back and make puns, poems and cryptic clues about future plans. That said, I thought that the origins of <i>Flamecraft Duals</i> (and the dubious grammar choice) deserved a little bit of a story. Now, keep in mind this is just a tale about how the game came to be designed, but I know you’re all here for some art reveals so let’s get desert first!<br/><br/><center><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8884545\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ne-twDXOe3Upt1W5JebJoA__small/img/iY57C1WL6qI5madBQEt11I5WDec=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8884545.png\" border=0></a></div></center><br/>The short version of the story goes like this: Peter asked if I had any ideas for a smaller game we could set in the <i>Flamecraft</i> universe and I lied and said, \"yes!\" I mean it wasn’t fully a lie because I have MANY designs in my notebook, but it’s not like I knew for sure that any would work for <i>Flamecraft</i>.<br/><br/>Quick side note here, the first thing I bought with money from <i>Flamecraft</i> was a ReMarkable digital notebook. I was so high on the success that all I wanted to do was start designing more games and I needed a place to store all my insanity. Currently I have over 1000 pages of notes just filled with ideas for “Flamecraft 2” going all the way back to February of 2022. I read through all of my notes and NOTHING in there was going to work as a smaller game! Expansion, sure. Huge new game with bell and whistles, also that. Small and <i>Flamecraft </i>were not in my mind. It would, however, spark the flame for the name, but I digress.<br/><br/>The longer story is that there was an event Cardboard Alchemy had been invited to participate in, and the time frame was very short. The thing is they were at the end of shipping <i>Andromeda’s Edge</i> and in the middle of shipping <i>Critter Kitchen</i>, not to mention developing things like <i>FlameBound</i> and other things I’m not supposed to talk about. Meanwhile, I’m 1000 pages into <i>Flamebound</i> and wrapping up <i>Tea Witches</i>, so the smart answer would have been, “we can’t do this right now.” Clearly, we are not one’s to make the smart choice and instead we <b>DOUBLED</b> down!<br/><br/>My magic notebook has many, many pages and I can make folders and copy things, move them around, it’s very cool. The big folder is <b>Flamecraft</b>, but another folder is just called <b>Ideas</b>, so I delved in to see what I could find. There are quite a few card games, some dice chuckers and even something about tossing pigeons, but the one idea that caught my eye I had named <i>Tic-Tac-Foe</i>. It was a bag draw game where all the player’s tokens were in the same bag and you played what you got and activated powers to prevent each other from scoring 4 in a row.<br/><br/><center><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8884572\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bAcAIaPYpKdJbRiqkXFizg__small/img/cH3exNMSZS_s6F3OU_AIWR0Dyz8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8884572.png\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>You can see the basic bones of Duals here, even the adorable dragon token that consumed an entire stack of anything it was placed on 😅. This idea was born BEFORE <i>Flamecraft</i>, but something about it never quite worked. It was overly thinky, and often your choices interfered with other players but did not help you in a meaningful way. Soon after I would find myself diving headfirst into <i>Flamecraft</i> design and this fell away, but never forgotten.<br/><br/>The game was already set-up in TTS, so it was easy to put some cute dragons on the tokens, use the village for a board and test the idea out quickly. It 100% did not work, but unlike <i>Tic-Tac-Foe</i> I instantly saw what the problem was. <i>Flamecraft</i> is all about sharing things, NOT owning the dragons and “gently removing” all others. This change in perspective led me to the idea of matching 3 dragons in a row, which was a perfect mirror for the 3 dragons in a shop. This meant almost every token could be used by either player to make progress and had a nice shared feel. From there it was easy to make a deck of shops, and the pieces literally fell into place. <br/><br/> <center><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8884583\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Z8Lt68vi9ByM5WcHVGmvWw__small/img/Da6besQoI_0COEp_xzF-QXD11BI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8884583.png\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>The ideas for the individual powers of each dragon was actually pretty easy, I had already worked out several abilities for the other game I just needed them to not discard things. This had the added benefit of giving the game a definite end which was sorely lacking in <i>Tic-Tac-Foe</i>. I spent a RIDICULOUS amount of time picking the abilities that best fit the artisan types, and rewording them to fit the gameplay and theme. For example, I knew I needed ways to draw tokens and Crystal had to be “draw 3 and keep 1” because of course the Crystal artisan gained 3 different goods, so three was very important!<br/><br/>I played the game with my kids and a few close friends to make sure it worked, and I am very happy to say it was humming along quite quickly. I also played with Sandara and she actually enjoyed it out of the gate (a true first for me 😀), but we agreed it needed something else. A hook of some kind, something new to add to the world of <i>Flamecraft</i>. That’s when I remembered my notes on page 147, where there was an idea for expansion hybrid dragons.<br/><br/><center><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8884590\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o7_O8Sci3xwJzzQsGv1wSQ__small/img/4-mlt2DHCTqGgEpmphOXY_fl1YI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8884590.png\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>This is the first instance, the first power ideas and first names I jotted down, and they have since changed quite a bit. I can't remember exactly why we never pursued this further, but I guess it was just waiting for the perfect place to reveal itself. This gave me the idea to add <b>DUAL</b> dragons (pun intended) to the game, and it just felt perfect that this 2-player game of friendly duels would bring new (old) dragons to <i>Flamecraft</i>!<br/><br/><center><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8884598\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PulhPhjpe3R1mshT7NxMaQ__small/img/Vf7uKm2EkSZ-iSlXjRpKIiSv4Ec=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8884598.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8884599\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mKCZvxwohmarHz6LP-3RVA__small/img/HtRQvfXaydF8YYoSVMArG_ai7zs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8884599.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8884600\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/weoDRmCRj3Cj7wyw2ZI9Dg__small/img/907x_VD_WEO6l4eEW2RbG4_VR3A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8884600.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8884601\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sucB6WvA_bhf8OePdvSdjA__small/img/XfWshIsftAGBhcT9yFgpgXXTQiE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8884601.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>Along with the dual dragons I had added some fancy dragon tokens, coins and statues into the bag for advanced play. These would trigger when drawn, and had their own special rules, but they would be honed and refined with playtesting as Luke and Peter tried desperately to reign in my love of chaos. I also went from a grid to a hex pattern that allowed for much smoother movement and a wonderful floor pattern. It didn’t take long as far as game development goes, but it did take too long to be part of the original event. Luckily people were enjoying the game so much, Cardboard Alchemy decided to put it directly into the schedule and here we are.<br/><br/><center><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8884608\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aHPeRuhUlHuQArMwjnzTxA__small/img/k3kqIQHSCBViQO_IqUaA9Wa5zYY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8884608.png\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>The moral of the story is that in game design, NEVER throw anything away. More importantly, never stop thinking about the different ways you can use and improve your ideas. You never know what pieces you will be able to use if another opportunity randomly crops up when you least expect it.<br/><br/>Thanks for all the support you all have given Flamecraft and Duals. It's been an absolute pleasure to work on this game and I really can't wait to get it into everyone's hands."

With all the variety of games out there per year? It's how it plays, primarily that I am concerned about. Some names are better than others and will get me interested. I stressed for a long time about calling Dwellings of Eldervale that name when BLOOD RAGE existed (and seemed catchier). But at the end of the day, gameplay and components and more won out, and I'm glad the name is unique in a game library.<br/><br/>If the main problems this game has is how it could have been named more correctly, we'll take it. 🙂 That said, appreciate the feedback.

Nice for sure, and some play very differently, adding to the variety of the challenge<br/>- Consolidated script books. Yes, nice, but it feels a bit wasteful to throw the old ones away.<br/>- New 'rulebook'. I'd used the Esoteric order of gamers condensed rules for a while now, so this probably of little additional benefit<br/><br/>When I saw the upgrade pack and its cost at the start of the campaign, I though it very poor value, but with so many useful, stretch goals being added, that value has changed. In pure 'will I play it often enough to justify the cost' terms, I think the value is still somewhat dubious. However I consider it a very special game, and a very special experience. That makes a difference.<br/><br/><br/>* whilst I like the over-arching story and faster gameplay of the scenarios, I also miss the exploration of the shelter.

XD I like the puzzle of survival a lot though! <br/><br/>And got it, thank you, I'd probably only play with one additional module and a scenario at a time, wouldn't do them all at once! Unles someone reccomends that mode of play but it sounds like a lot haha. Besides doing only small bits at once increases replay value which is great ^^<br/><br/>I'm reallyyyy looking forward to the new main board maps, they look amazing! I struggle to survive on the current advanced sid of the board sp interested to see what those are like "

            "body": "The game is so difficult that I can't even enjoy all it has to offer as everyone only has 1 action by turn 3. I can't even make a fitting and use it until the next turn, and by that time there is too much snowballing negative statuses to do any actions whatsoever. I need to have some semblance of agency to have a balance of tension. <br/><br/>Take a look at Psycho Raiders by EofEE. The game is literally founded on the idea that the good guys are going to lose. It's how close you can come with impossibile odds. It hits the sweets spot because it gives the good guys just enough agency to think they have a chance. Here, unless you follow an extremely rigid strategy,  you fail. You don't have enough ability to explore the game and become engaged with your characters enough before they meet a tragic end. <br/><br/>In the game The Village, you feel a certain sense of loss when your meeples die because they gave you a consistent benefit before they died. Therefore you value them. If you can't do enough to use a character before they die because they have only 1 action by turn 2, you won't develop that value.  This game plummets you downhill so fast you don't get time to explore the characters and let them create value by their actions.<br/><br/>1. Everyone starts with hunger 1.<br/>2. Starting supplies: +1 water + 1 knife. <br/>3. The fireman comes with a hatchet. (I spent 4 turns trying to build that f*cking thing last game). <br/>4. No 1st event.<br/>5. Sleeping in a bed at night can prevent an increase in illness. <br/>6. Two people to a bed (spooning).<br/><br/>That's it. That should give me enough room to do enough to get a head start and explore how to play the game. After I get better I'll go back to the old rules.<br/>"
