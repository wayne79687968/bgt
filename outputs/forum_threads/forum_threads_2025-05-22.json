            "body": "<div><img border=0 src=\"https://www.bordspelwereld.nl/images/bgg/419639.jpg\"></div><br/><br/><b>Do you also suffer from the fact that a drawing never turns out the way you had in mind? Fortunately, in the party game Krakel Orakel, that doesn't matter at all! All you have to do is make sure your fellow players can guess what you drew, no matter how ugly your creation is.<br/>What is Krakel Orakel?</b><br/><br/>Krakel Orakel is a (German!) cooperative drawing game for two to eight players. It is a party game, similar to Pictionary, where each player has to draw a word and the others have to guess which word belongs to it. Not being able to draw is no excuse not to participate in this game: in Krakel Orakel you do not draw on an ordinary sheet of paper, but are required to use the pre-printed lines on your drawing tablet. The players collectively win the game when four rounds are over and not too many minus points are scored.<br/><br/><b>How is the game played?<br/><br/>Setup</b><br/>Each player gets a double-sided drawing tablet and a marker. Players get to choose which side of the drawing tablet to use. There is also a joint decision as to whether to play with the easy words (in the white area) or the more difficult words (in the black area). The word cards are shuffled and placed on the table as a covered stack. A cell phone, for example, is also needed to set a timer.<br/>Please note that this game is in German! If you do not speak German, use a dictionary or translation site or simply skip unfamiliar words.<br/><br/><b>Gameplay</b><br/>Each round consists of two parts:<br/><i>'Krakeln' </i>- Drawing simultaneously.<br/>Each player picks up a word card. As soon as everyone knows what to draw, the two-minute timer is started and everyone draws simultaneously. There are few rules associated with drawing, but the most important ones are that you may only draw on the pre-drawn lines and you may not draw letters and/or numbers.<br/><br/><i>'Orakeln' </i>- Guessing words.<br/>After the timer expires, the guessing part starts. The word cards of all players are collected and to these are added as many word cards from the draw pile as there are players (so with four players you have eight cards). All these cards are now placed face up on the table and the players take turns choosing a word card which they think does not appear on any of the drawings. When everyone has done this (and there are as many words left on the table as there are players), the players may say whether their word is still there yes or no. If a word is wrongly not excluded, this card goes on a discard pile: these are the minus points.<br/><br/><b>End of the game</b><br/>The game ends after four rounds, or as soon as the players have collectively accumulated too many minus points. Too many minus points in this case means that more minus points have been scored than there are players participating. For example: when there are five players, the maximum number of minus points is also five.<br/><br/><b>What do I think of Krakel Orakel?</b><br/><br/>Party games are normally not quite my thing and especially not when I have to draw and/or depict something and then the other person has to guess. Krakel Orakel, on the other hand, is all hilarity. It doesn't matter if you can compete with Picasso or if you can't even draw a heart on a Valentine's card: this game is fun for everyone and that takes the pressure off to “perform\". It's also cooperative, although no one I played this game with was concerned with winning or losing. Trying to explain how on earth to recognize something in some crazy lines, that's what keeps you busy during this game.<br/><br/>So the rules are also a bit redundant in my opinion. Just 'drawing' and guessing is fun enough and guessing from the cards that are laid out doesn't have that much added value. I certainly get the idea, because sometimes it seems almost impossible to make any sense of another player's creation and then it's nice to use the cards as hints. If I could choose, I would play Krakel Orakel without those rules and indeed simply draw and guess. The very best aspect of this game is trying to explain what you drew and seeing the confusion and surprise in the eyes of your fellow players.<br/><br/>One drawback, of course, is that this game is in German. It is really worth using a dictionary or something similar or maybe even making word cards in your own language.<br/><br/><b>Final verdict</b><br/>Krakel Orakel is a hilarious party game. Not only suitable for lovers of party games, but certainly also for players who do not normally indulge in them. It lends itself to adapting the rules to how you like and what suits the player group. This is not a game to be taken seriously, but just go crazy and accept that your drawing skills will never get beyond the drawing tablet in Krakel Orakel.<br/><br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://www.bordspelwereld.nl/images/logo/bordspelwereld_bgg.jpg\"></div><br/>The original (Dutch) review was written by: Bianca Dijkshoorn (DeBordspellentuin), published on 11-01-2025 by Bordspelwereld on their website, with a rating of <b>8/10 stars</b><br/>Read the Dutch original here: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.bordspelwereld.nl/nl/reviews-nl/nieuwste-reviews/krakel-orakel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.bordspelwereld.nl/nl/reviews-nl/nieuwste-reviews...</a><br/>Read the English translation here: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://bordspelwereld.nl/en/ratings/krakel-orakel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://bordspelwereld.nl/en/ratings/krakel-orakel</a><br/>Read the German translation here: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.bordspelwereld.nl/de/bewertungen/neueste-bewertungen/krakel-orakel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.bordspelwereld.nl/de/bewertungen/neueste-bewertu...</a><br/><br/><i>The English translation was translated from Dutch by DeepL.

Which we hope to find for Krakel-Orakel. 🙂 <br/>Language dependence might not be as high as it seems, by the way. You need to understand the word on your own card (google translate can help when in doubt) - once all cards are open on the table, one person who can read and translate (or your phone again) will be sufficient.

ARE YOU READY???  <center><br/></center></center><br/>It’s time to prepare again for long voyages in distant lands. Your clan needs your help. Go and bring back supplies, food, materials and all that it’s needed to develop your settlement.  <br/><br/>In Looot you take the role of a Viking clan leader, competing on growing the most prosperous Viking clan. How do you do it, you ask? By filling your longships with goods that you manage to loot in your raid. The winner of this contest will be crowned Jarl of the Vikings! <br/><br/><center> <div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860557\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cPVu6w-mtbyt_W37_9yLOA__small/img/VJI1ZW8iKwWTh3_1ZH21O7AtD1w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860557.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><br/>GAMEPLAY <br/></center><br/>What does a Viking village need to grow big? Well, … a lot of stuff: axes, wood, sheep, gold and of course a good strategist as a leader. And from where do you get all these riches? From the central map of course!  <br/><br/>The game takes places in 2 zones. The central board where all the resources are, and the personal board, where you have your fjord, the village you must grow, that is really empty at the beginning of the game. But do not worry, even if the personal board seems so empty and big at the beginning of the game, I promise you that you will come back a rich man and you will surely be able to fill that board.  <br/><br/><center><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860558\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QJSNhpL3Oy-dvHkVNSnElQ__small/img/qeNAGOq77YkPR4unK2EoJYZufYg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860558.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>The game can be played by 2 to 4 players, and depending on the player count, the central game board is composed of a number of landscape boards equal to the number of players. So the game board map will be equally crowded if you play in 2 or 4 players. We tried the game both ways and those Vikings were everywhere gathering stuff, filling their longships. The atmosphere was like it was their first Black Friday.  <br/><br/>The map is divided into small hexes, each one with a printed resource on them. The majority of hexes will give you common resources, like axes, wood, sheeps and gold. You will gain the printed resource when you occupy the hex with one of your Vikings. But there are some spaces that cannot be occupied, but even so, they have some special rules that will help you gain something, if you manage to accomplish their requirement.  <br/><br/><center><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860559\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/K0J_Ma-6aKunU4qhr83jAw__small/img/0kuU9hOpmv1xWnC2imwCYPuOMhs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860559.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>Each player will have 13 Viking meeples that he will use to gather resources. If a Viking is placed on the map he will stay there untill the end of the game. Speaking of, the game will end when all players have placed all of their Vikings on the map.  <br/><center><br/><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860560\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hPnxBW-GvBatGMgD-wYJEA__small/img/mdxxrfHT2d8AC0LVnV4ZxQqLVLw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860560.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>The invasion begins from a side of the board, where the longships are docked. The first player will need to place his first Viking on a tile adjacent to the longships, the next player can put his Viking on a tile adjacent to the longships or on a tile adjacent to the other Viking placed on the board by the first player. This will lead on creating a link of Vikings from different tribes, but you must be careful and pay attention on how you place your Vikings, because not only the resource gained from the tile you have placed it on matters, but the fact that your Vikings are linked and their number and position are also important. The players have the chance to sabotage one another when they are placing their meeples on the board. And on a 4 player game there will be a lot of variation and things will get more complicated.  <br/><br/><center><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860564\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U6sphfKgGY21LbxQijI4pA__small/img/1huIXmBWmbsuSp-VCzFhHmZZsig=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860564.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>You will score points depending on what you manage to bring back from the raid. <br/><br/>There are 3 big sections of tiles that will score you points.  <br/><br/>The first ones are the common resource tiles. When you place a Viking on a hex on the central map, you will take a tile with that resource and place it on your personal board. Each of the tiles representing axes, wood, sheep and gold will score you points at the end of the game.  <br/><center><br/><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860565\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kxToM7Zf5kzebEc7Z1mpKg__small/img/qnK1iy5GUEzumHLHwgqdO_kUVeA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860565.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>The second ones are the construction sites. Each player starts the game with 3 random tiles representing a Port, an Altar and the Jarl Palace. If you manage to build them until the end of the game they will score you points.  <br/><br/>The third section is represented by the captured buildings. These are the special tiles that you can capture from the central board. There are 3 types of buildings, each with their own rules. These buildings are limited, so you must be careful to get them before your opponents. Each landscape board comes with 5 five slots for the special buildings, 2 houses, 2 towers and 1 fortress. On each of these spaces there will be a pile of tiles, on the houses and towers there will be 2 tiles, and on the fortress space there will be placed 3 fortress tiles.  <br/><br/><center><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860570\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IkChtCS6nRsKQNJFPIv4Xg__small/img/WHX2RTiXt3paAOjbGHNIlcFZjG8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860570.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>Houses are the most easy to capture. You will need to place an Viking adjacent to a house and it is yours. The watchtowers are a bit more complicated to capture, but if you are a good commander and place your troops in good positions on the board, nothing is impossible. To capture the watchtower you will need to link two different watchtower by a chain of Vikings. When you do that you will gain both watchtowers linked. There is also the fortress, it will require a big army to be captured. To get the first tile from the pile you will need to have a group of 4 connected Vikings, with at least one of them touching the fortress, to get the 2nd and 3rd tile from the pile you will need to increase your army to 8, respectively 12 Vikings.  <br/><br/>The fact that these three tiles of buildings are limited will make the battle for them more intense, besides the fact that they're worth points at the end of the game, they are one of the required tiles that are used when you build your construction sites on your personal board.  <br/><br/><center><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860571\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/K896G949HrKJYCFpatCmIA__small/img/Zcezajxl-ySa6BGHPjaGJUpsqLs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860571.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>The longships and the construction sites have something in common. These tiles, when placed on your board, to score at the end of the game, will require to be adjacent to other tiles to be completed and score points. For the construction sites the most important resources needed are the Building tiles, for the Longships the requirements are made of the common resource tiles. The Construction sites will grant you only victory points, but they are quite valorous. On the other hand, the Longships will not grant you victory points directly, each longships will give you bonus points for a particular type of resource of building.  <br/><br/>On each of your turns you can get one of the 4 face up longships. Even so, you must pay attention to the bonus the longships will give you, because getting bonus points for the resources you have a small number on your board it’s not a good deal. Usually the resources required to complete a longship are different than the resource the longship will grant you bonus points for. <br/><br/><center><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860572\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zHfxId33Qoq3fVq_vXcMEA__small/img/NBsJGhSrMPPuXrj1-_5UGCdutes=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860572.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>The real puzzle is to arrange all the resources and longships on your board. It’s very important to use the same resources on completing multiple longships/construction sites. And one other thing you must pay attention to are the available longships, here you must calculate if it’s worth getting one of the ones available or not. The temptation is always there, but you must know that your turns are limited and you risk remaining with the longship incomplete, and this will get you penalized.  <br/><br/>There is also a mini race on getting axes quickly, there are 5 trophies available and they can be redeemed by anyone on his turn, as long as the player has the required amount of axes on his player board. The most points can be gained if you have 6 axes, and after one of the trophies it’s taken, the other players must get the ones with a lower number of axes that will grant them fewer victory points. It’s one thing that you must pay attention to, because sometimes you will forget to count your axes, and even if you already have them on your board, another player can claim the trophy on his turn.  <br/><br/><center><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860574\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Odhkst8KJtuT6xZ-iGmXQQ__small/img/6J52SaQGVUWQ-lDgaoaNiFphg7o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860574.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>Even if the game will seem tight, especially because of the rule that just one Viking can occupy a hex, there are 3 tokens with one time use that will help you a bit in conquering the new lands and bring back more Looot. In my opinion the most useful is the one that lets you place a Viking on a tile already occupied by another Viking. There is a real struggle to link the towers, or to make big groups of Viking for the fortress sieges. Players will always try to sabotage the other players so they can’t get the bonuses, but with this tile you have a chance to remedy the situation. The next one is the one that will let you place one additional Viking on the board on your turn, this also will help you get a bit quicker the tiles you want, especially to use them when you want to gain towers or fortresses. And the last one is the one that will let you get two resources instead of one when you place a Viking. This one is useful especially at the end of the game, when you have few Vikings left and you need more resources for all these longship you took without calculating your turns…  <br/><br/><center><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860578\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rF_Fk78EnzxOoK5Q3SSC3Q__small/img/mhFDYVWJvdwd3rZ5TQMtA_Yfo0M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860578.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><br/>ARTWORK AND COMPONENTS </center><br/><br/>The game has a good quality, we loved the wooden Viking shaped meeples. It has a modular board that will be larger or smaller depending on the number of players.  The tokens and tiles are made of cardboard.  <br/><br/><center><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860581\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NtK7qWePacQnViSEYQycKA__small/img/QUaIZuN0DOcifxHAmdW0xPpMQqY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860581.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>The iconography of the game is simple, and it helps a lot in playing the game, you will not need any aid sheet or to consult the rulebook through the game.  The artwork on the game components is simple but beautiful.  <br/><br/><center> <div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860582\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UTk4d0W-VAEQcHWQ9YkPSg__small/img/XaNwkXKwRgLLoSL5AvnCBKtkIUM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860582.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><br/>FINAL THOUGHTS </center><br/><br/>We really like the puzzle you must solve in this game. It will start light, with an empty board ready to be filled and a lot of opportunities, and by the end of the game everything will get really tight.  <br/><br/>There are a lot of things you must pay attention to at the same time, getting the resources you need, getting the supplementary building tiles that you can capture. The struggle and fight will be on these tiles, but the other common resources also count.  <br/><br/><center><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860584\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JAJQ82_jOJuF29rU-S1yYQ__small/img/vGRb1poPlGuJ64I_1VAk6gwd9N0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860584.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>The way your board fills throughout the game is very satisfying, and the attention you must give to every one of the tiles to place there will keep you hooked on the game. Trying to fulfill as many longships as you can, but also getting bonuses for the most type of tiles you have on your board will be a challenge.  <br/><br/>The race for the trophy tiles is nice, the points gained from the trophies are quite important.  <br/><br/><center><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860585\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ClIfN0TuNh_o8a_NtH1hXg__small/img/5jhffajiAz1Pk9786kPFAfC7yDE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860585.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>One thing that we appreciated in this game is the player interaction. Even if on your player board everything is nice and calm, there is only you that can arrange the tiles, on the central board things are really getting wild, especially in 4 players. Here it’s done the real war for resources and victory points. You will try to sabotage other players on getting resources, especially to capture building tiles. But your Vikings are also limited, you must place them in such manner that they will not only sabotage your opponent, but also to benefit you by getting the resources you need. <br/><br/><center><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860590\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Vztz6cURKJM-_IvT-RVBSA__small/img/zDSmvSlM56xn9RS1gQ9dS93qHbA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860590.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><br/>The game is really easy to learn and to be explained. It is played in only half an hour. Makes it a perfect game when you don’t have too much time and you feel the need to make a quick viking raid and come back with a lot of “Looot”.  <br/><br/>RATING 8/10.  <br/><br/><br/>Disclaimer: A review copy of this game was provided to us by the publisher.    <br/><br/>Check out our reviews here: <a  href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/332384/our-reviews\"   >Our Reviews</a>  <br/><br/>You can follow us on instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/boardgamecolors/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">BoardGameColors</a> <br/><br/><center><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8861034\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fRTJFittMYkzYOuxWZQn-A__small/img/3WMurvx0gVOUVYWz_Ys9gRVkVSQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8861034.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><br/><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860594\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ye910oWH7Co_pGlzuq2N5w__small/img/GZLeVFCZqm33VmwiJXAWEvTW_9Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860594.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><br/><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860595\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4PrsMVksYtLUAWg4qa7I3Q__small/img/u-72sVvNEi7o7uhjKP-oCbhMYzE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860595.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><br/><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860596\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o20k69mQx2gFW2EQ23TFKA__small/img/GkYUs8JD4sw2DEmIhmDTjEqPij8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860596.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><br/><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8860598\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M30oDyNgKpZKDZ3Gb3E7aA__small/img/QPq5hlOmpd6ESCzjflSCX0XfikM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8860598.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center>"

Vlooot (Looot in English version) is one of those games. With its colorful board, cheerful-looking Vikings, and a bag full of longships, it may seem like a light and breezy pastime. But behind that friendly appearance hides a cleverly designed puzzle game, where you build, plan, and strike at just the right moment. In this review, I’ll take you on a journey through fjords, trade routes, and Viking ambition – and show you why Vlooot might be a game worth setting sail for.</b><br/><br/><br/><b>From Fjord to Fortress: A Viking Adventure in Vlooot</b><br/>Step aboard your own longship and prepare for a strategic adventure in the rugged fjords of Scandinavia. In Vlooot, you take on the role of a Viking leader trying to develop your fjord into the most prosperous region in the North. The theme is immediately present: your fjord is your home base, the longships represent your trading fleet, and constructing altars, ports, and Jarl palaces shows how your settlement grows in wealth and prestige.<br/><br/>What makes this game shine is how the Viking theme is woven not just into the artwork but also into the mechanics. You place Vikings on the game board, gather resources like wood, gold, and sheep (yes, sheep!), and use them to expand your fjord. But the real fun begins with the longships: they represent trade and adventure, and reward you with bonus points if you manage to fill them with the right combination of resources. It really feels like you’re making clever moves to increase your riches.<br/><br/>Constructing castles, watchtowers, and houses further strengthens the feeling of building a thriving Viking settlement. And of course, there’s competition – you want to be crowned Jarl, so every point counts. Vlooot captures the feeling of expansion and tactical control in a way that’s both accessible and thematically rich. You’re constantly weighing your options, planning ahead, and building up – just like a true Viking strategist.<br/><br/><br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://www.brdgmz.nl/wp-content/uploads/Vlooot-07.jpg\"></div><br/><br/><br/><b>Colorful Cardboard in Viking Style</b><br/>When you lay Vlooot on the table, one of the first things you’ll notice is how inviting and well-designed everything looks. The components are colorful without being loud, and the illustrations – by Naïade – have a charming, almost storybook quality that fits the theme perfectly. Picture softly rolling fjords, friendly-looking Vikings (no bloodthirsty raiders here!), and buildings that bring your settlement to life.<br/><br/>The game boards and tiles are made of sturdy cardboard and feel solid in hand. You get landscape boards that form the main playing area, plus your own personal fjord board where you place collected resources, ships, and buildings. Everything has its place, which helps keep the game organized and easy to follow.<br/>The longships are arguably the most satisfying components: they come out of a cloth bag and show a beautifully illustrated boat on one side, and a bonus on the other. Filling a longship with the right resources and flipping it over is surprisingly rewarding – it feels like completing a successful trade expedition.<br/><br/>The small wooden shields and colorful Viking tokens also add to the charm. They’re simple, but functional, and give the game that little bit of tactile joy. Altogether, Vlooot radiates quality and playfulness, without ever feeling overdone.<br/><br/><br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://www.brdgmz.nl/wp-content/uploads/Vlooot-02.jpg\"></div><br/><br/><b>Game Components of Vlooot</b><br/>The game includes a fair number of components, but once everything is laid out, it feels well-organized and approachable.

Each turn consists of one required action and several optional ones. The game is easy to learn but offers surprising strategic depth.<br/><br/>Turn structure (in short):<br/><b>1.\tPlace a Viking (required)</b><br/>Place a Viking on an unoccupied landscape tile (adjacent to another Viking or a longship). Take the corresponding resource (wood, sheep, gold, or axe) and place it on your fjord.<br/><b>2.\tCapture a building (optional)</b><br/>If you meet the requirements, you may take a building tile (house, watchtower, or castle) and place it on your fjord. Each building scores points and helps complete construction sites.<br/><b>3.\tComplete a construction site (optional)</b><br/>Place the required resources and buildings around your port, altar, or Jarl palace. Completed sites score points immediately.<br/><b>4.\tClaim a longship (optional)</b><br/>Choose a longship and place it on your fjord. If you surround it with the right resources, you receive a bonus that boosts your scoring.<br/><b>5.\tUse a shield (optional)</b><br/>You have three one-time-use shields that grant special actions, such as gaining double resources or placing on an occupied space.<br/><b>6.\tClaim a trophy (optional, once per game)</b><br/><br/>If you’ve collected enough axes, you can claim a trophy for a one-time score bonus. But be quick—each trophy can only be claimed once.<br/><br/>Players take turns placing Vikings until all have been used. Then, the final scoring begins, and the new Jarl is crowned.<br/><br/>The full rules are clearly explained in the <a href=\"https://www.brdgmz.nl/wp-content/uploads/Spelregels-Vlooot-English.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">rulebook</a>, with examples and strategic tips. Or check out the how-to-play video below.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoD0t7AQd8Q\">Youtube Video</a><br/><br/><b>Tactical Moves in Viking Territory</b><br/>What makes Vlooot interesting is the balance it strikes between tactical gameplay and accessibility. You’re constantly making decisions: where to place your next Viking, which resource to prioritize, and how to work toward multiple goals at once. Everything hinges on efficiency. Since space around your fjord is limited, you’ll need to plan carefully. In that sense, Vlooot feels like a tactical puzzle with satisfying constraints.<br/><br/><b>A Dash of Luck, But Never Frustrating</b><br/>There’s a small element of luck—such as which longships become available, or whether a building gets taken before you reach it—but it never feels unfair. There’s almost always another path to take. There are no dice; it’s about adapting to what’s available and making smart choices.<br/><br/><b>Gentle Interaction With a Sharp Edge</b><br/>There’s almost no bluffing involved, but player interaction is present in subtle ways. You can block a space or snatch a longship or building tile just before someone else does. It’s not harsh or aggressive, but it adds just enough tension to keep things interesting. You’ll need to pay attention to what others are doing without it becoming a cutthroat affair.<br/><br/><b>Always Engaged, Even When It’s Not Your Turn</b><br/>The interaction may be gentle, but it keeps you involved throughout. You’re watching others build, choose ships, or claim trophies you had your eye on. The game invites you to follow everyone’s progress and adjust your own plans accordingly.<br/><br/><b>High Replayability, Always a New Challenge</b><br/>The replay value is strong. With random longships, varying construction sites, and a modular board setup, no two games play the same. And the choices you make—whether to focus on castles or ship bonuses—create different rhythms and outcomes each time.<br/><br/><b>Strategic, Light, and a Bit Different Each Time</b><br/>In short, Vlooot isn’t a fierce strategic duel, but it does offer a clever mix of planning, timing, and tactical flexibility. It keeps your mind engaged without becoming overly complex or slow.<br/><br/><br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://www.brdgmz.nl/wp-content/uploads/Vlooot-06.jpg\"></div><br/><br/><br/><b>Who Is Vlooot For?</b><br/>Vlooot is perfect for players who enjoy tactical planning without needing a full mental workout. It’s accessible for families and casual gamers, yet offers enough depth to appeal to more experienced players—especially those who like discovering subtle strategies through repeat play. You don’t need to be a seasoned board gamer to enjoy it, but if you like thoughtful decision-making and a sense of progress, you’ll feel right at home.<br/><br/>If you’re mainly into heavy conflict games or bluffing mechanics, Vlooot might feel a bit too gentle. The interaction is mostly about outmaneuvering others by timing your actions well—but don’t expect sabotage or blocking-heavy gameplay. Even when competition heats up, the tone stays polite.<br/>It also works well for younger players (around age ten and up), especially with an adult at the table. The symbols are clear, the actions are intuitive, and the rules are surprisingly quick to teach—which isn’t always the case with games that have this many components.<br/><br/>As for player count, Vlooot shines with three or four players. The board becomes more lively, competition is tighter, and the pacing stays smooth. It plays fine with two, but the dynamics are slightly calmer and more predictable.<br/><br/>All in all, Vlooot is a versatile game that works both as a family-friendly activity and as a relaxing, tactical experience for hobby gamers. As long as you’re not looking for heavy confrontation and instead enjoy smart decision-making wrapped in a beautiful theme, it’s a strong choice.<br/><br/><br/><b>Conclusion</b><br/>Vlooot is a surprisingly refined game in an approachable package. It combines the joy of building with tactical decision-making and light interaction, all without feeling slow or heavy. You’re constantly weighing options—whether to grab a ship bonus, work on a construction site, or rush to grab a trophy before someone else does. That steady stream of small, meaningful choices keeps you engaged from start to finish.<br/><br/>What makes the game especially appealing is how well the visuals and mechanics are integrated. From the illustrations to the scoring system, everything feels cohesive. The Viking theme isn’t just decorative—it’s embedded in every action you take.<br/><br/>For families, casual gamers, and strategists who like their games light but clever, Vlooot is a welcome addition to the shelf. Don’t expect brutal confrontations or deep complexity, but rather a friendly competitive experience that feels fresh each time you play. Thanks to its modular setup and multiple paths to victory, Vlooot invites you to return to the fjords again and again.<br/><br/>Whether you're looking for a charming family game or a laid-back tactical puzzle, Vlooot finds just the right balance between fun, challenge, and atmosphere.<br/><br/><b>Score:</b> <img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/star_yellow.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /><img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/star_yellow.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /><img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/star_yellow.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /><img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/star_yellow.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /><img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/star_yellow.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /><img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/star_yellow.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /><img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/star_yellow.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /><img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/star_white.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /><img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/star_white.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /><img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/star_white.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /> (7/10)<br/><br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://www.brdgmz.nl/wp-content/uploads/Speloverzicht-Vlooot.jpg\"></div>"

            "body": "Review-Fazit zu „Kauri“, einem assymetrischen Strategiespiel.<br/><br/>[Infos]<br/>für: 2-4 Spieler<br/>ab: 10 Jahren<br/>ca.-Spielzeit: 40-60min.<br/>Autor: Charlec Couronnaud<br/>Illustration: Jérémie Fleury<br/>Verlag: Koalla Spiele<br/>Anleitung: deutsch<br/>Material: sprachneutral<br/><br/>[Download: Anleitung/Übersichten]<br/>engl.: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://debacle.fr/project/kauri/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://debacle.fr/project/kauri/</a> (s. Downloads)<br/><br/>[Fazit]<br/>Zur Zeit der Erstbesiedlung Neuseelands treffen vier Fraktionen aufeinander, die von den Spielern jeweils punktemäßig zum Sieg geführt werden wollen. Die anlandenen Engländer, die Māori-Ureinwohner, die Kiwis und die eingeschleppten Possums stehen sich hier gegenüber. Allesamt spielen sich unterschiedlich, verfügen über verschiedene Spielkomponenten und verfolgen jeweils ihre eigene Agenda.<br/>Die Kiwis wollen nur mit den überall auf der Insel residierenden Kauri-Bäume überleben und müssen sich daher geschickt den holzfällenden Engländern und den sie vertreibenden Possums entziehen. Die Engländer wollen das Land vereinnahmen und fällen die wertvollen Bäume und nehmen damit den Kiwis ihren Platz. Nach einer Weile des Spielverlaufs allerdings, gewinnen die Engländer eine Art Gewissen und gehen eher auf die Possumjagd denn Bäume zu schreddern. Den Possums ist alles egal, die vermehren sich permanent und breiten sich einfach aus, die Masse macht’s. Die Māori hingegen wollen im Einklang mit der Natur ihre heiligen Tempel bauen und schützen.<br/>Nach 5 spannenden Runden, in denen es durchaus hin und her gehen kann, steht der Sieger via Punkten fest.<br/><br/>Per Zug spielen alle verdeckt zwei Karten von der Hand (insgesamt 3 Karten) aus. Eine wird quergelegt und gibt die Initiative an, also wer dann den Zug als Erster ausführen wird und die zweite Karte zeigt die gewünschte Aktion an, die durchgeführt werden soll. Sind alle bereit, werden die Karten gemeinsam aufgedeckt.<br/>Entsprechend der festgestellten Reihenfolge führen die Spieler nun ihre Aktion(en) aus. Diese sind u.a. Vermehrung bei den Possums, zwei neue werden an der Stelle hinzugefügt, wo schon mindestens ein Possum steht. Fällen eines Kauri-Baums ist eine der Aktionsmöglichkeiten der Engländer (als Baumfäller) – später werden dann Possums „gesammelt“ (als Jäger). Kiwis bewegen sich in erster Linie von Feld zu Feld(ern) und vertreiben Possums. Die Aktionen gibt es allesamt in unterschiedlicher „Stärke“ plus Varianten.<br/>Dies geht insgesamt viermal so, dann endet eine Runde. Am Ende einer Runde wird der aktuelle Status festgestellt. So werden z.B. Kiwis ohne Kauri-Baum auf ihrem Feld entfernt. Zudem kann es zu Plagen kommen. Die Spieler mischen ihre Karten und eine neue Runde beginnt – der Rundenmarker wird vorgezogen und damit auch der „Gewissensmarker“ der Engländer.<br/><br/>Nach 5 Runden endet das Spiel dann und es wird abgerechnet. So erhalten z.B. die Kiwis Punkte für ihre Anzahl und die Engländer pro Baum und Possum in ihrem Lager.<br/><br/>Ein wunderschön gestaltetes Spiel mit sehr wertigem Material liegt hier vor. Die geschickt eingewobenen unterschiedlichen Spielziele und -taktiken der einzelnen Fraktionen sorgen für hohen Wiederspielreiz und einer Menge Kurzweil im Spielverlauf. Die Engländer mit anfänglich nur einer Figur auf dem Plan, aber der Möglichkeit Straßen zu verlegen, um später schneller vorwärts zu kommen, lassen sich besonders vorausschauend spielen. Die Possums gehen i.d.R. mit der Brechstange vor^^ und die Kiwis sind gar nicht so die Opfer, wenn deren Spezialfähigkeiten wie Vulkanausbruch oder Überflutung passend genutzt werden. Auch die Māori fügen sich gut strategisch ein.<br/>Der Zugang ist recht gut strukturiert erklärt und die Ziele durchweg klar. Ist das Spiel einmal bekannt, verläuft eine Partie „nur“ noch gut eine Stunde und bietet damit auch die Möglichkeit mehrerer Partien.<br/>Rundum ein feines Spiel im Bereich gehobener Familienspiele.<br/><br/>[Note lt. Kompetenz-Team]<br/>5 von 6 Punkten.<br/><br/>[Links]<br/>BGG: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/381188/kauri\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/381188/kauri</a><br/>HP: n/a<br/>Ausgepackt: n/a<br/><br/>[Galerie: 16 Fotos]<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.heimspiele.info/HP/?p=38131\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.heimspiele.info/HP/?p=38131</a>"

Bis auf ein einen Fehler unsererseits lief das Spiel recht flüssig (und ich denke Fehlerfrei).<br/><br/>Einige Ikonographien auf den Karten könnten besser und konsistenter sein (z.B. sollte für die Aktionen erkennbar sein, ob eine Figur in der Region anwesend sein muss oder nicht; bei bestimmten Karten wie z.B. Tempel sind Vorbedingungen bereits angegeben).<br/>Andere passen meiner Meinung nach nicht ganz zum Rest der Illustrationen (z.B. die Hand bei der Maori-Jagd-Aktion).<br/>In dem beiliegenden Heft für jede Fraktion werden alle möglichen Aktionen der Karten aber gut erklärt.<br/><br/>Insgesamt ging das Spiel für eine erste Partie recht schnell (unter 2 Stunden inklusive Aufbau und Regelerklärung).<br/>Die Spielzeit wird beim erneuten Spielen sicher weiter sinken.<br/><br/>Das Aktionssystem funktioniert wie folgt: Eine Karte behält man immer auf der Hand. Zu Zugbeginn zieht man zwei Weitere. Aus diesen drei Karten wählt man eine als Aktionskarte, eine andere bestimmt die Initiative.<br/>Dadurch ist ein gewisser Glücksfaktor vorhanden, ob man auch das machen kann, was man gerne tun möchte.<br/>Zudem fühlt sich dadurch der Zug ein wenig vorgegeben und ohne viel Spielraum an (jedenfalls für die Maori, die ich gespielt habe).<br/>Auf der anderen Seite verhindert dies Analysis Paralysis.<br/><br/>Hervorzuheben ist, wie unterschiedlich sich die Fraktionen spielen. Die Maori sind eine einzelne Figur die sich über die Karte bewegen und Tempel bauen, während die Kiwis (am Anfang) überall auf der Karte verteilt sind und ums Überleben kämpfen. Der Engländer hingegen holzt alles ab.<br/>Das macht auf jeden Fall Lust auf mehr und ich freue mich darauf, die anderen Fraktionen auszuprobieren.<br/><br/>Insgesamt hat mir das Spiel sehr gut gefallen und ich kann es kaum erwarten, es wieder auf den Tisch zu bekommen.<br/>Wie gut die Fraktionen ausbalanciert sind und wie hoch der Wiederspielwert auf Dauer ist, muss sich noch zeigen."

Nic więcej nie trzeba, by zainteresować mnie jakimś tytułem. Jak do tego dojdzie informacja, że autor jest Polakiem i tworzy grę z Polską w tle, to muszę to koniecznie sprawdzić. Tak właśnie stało się z prototypem gry Principes od Lwa Sołowieja, o której ufundowanie na Gamefoundzie walka rozpocznie się 20 maja 2025 roku. Ja swoją pierwszą partię rozegrałem na Festiwalu ALEgramy w Gdańsku. Warto wspomnieć, że ją wygrałem i to rzutem na taśmę, co wzmożyło moje zachwyty nad tym tytułem. Na szczęście kilka tygodni temu otrzymałem do testów prototyp, który mogłem sprawdzić w warunkach kontrolowanych, z mniejszą dawką ekscytacji i z zaliczonymi kilkoma przegranymi.<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1_principes-960x639.jpg\"></div><br/>Principes to asymetryczna gra strategiczna dla 2-4 graczy (tryb solo się tworzy). Partia powinna zmieścić się w 2,5 godziny. Rozgrywka jest stosunkowo skomplikowana, a jak dodamy do tego kwestie gry nad stołem, to myślę, że rozsądnym byłoby napisać, że do stołu powinni usiąść minimum dwunastolatkowie. <br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>Tytuł traktuje o rozbiciu dzielnicowym Polski w XIII wieku. Wcielimy się w głowy poszczególnych linii rodu Piastów, które rządziły w tamtym czasie najważniejszymi dzielnicami — Małopolską, Wielkopolską, Mazowszem oraz Śląskiem. Każda z frakcji ma swoją specjalną zdolność, talię Książąt (która jak się wyczerpie, eliminuje gracza i odpala proces zakończenia gry — każdy principes ma również swoją umiejętność) oraz ustalone miejsce i rozstawienie na mapie.<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>Gra podzielona jest na trzy okresy po dwie rundy każdy. Okresy mają kilka funkcji. Po pierwsze na początku każdego rozstawiamy nasze księżniczki (o których napiszę później), talia dziejów (czyli wydarzeń), którą tworzymy na początku każdego okresu, jest od nich uzależniona (wchodzą po dwie karty na okres, czyli jedna na rundę), a książęta z obecnego okresu na jego koniec umierają i musimy wybrać tych z nadchodzącego, co przypomina nam o upływie czasu i konieczności dbania o swoich przywódców.<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>W trakcie gry będziemy rozbudowywać swoje włości, podbijać nowe, starali się utrzymać kontrolę, zdobywać poparcie ludu i kleru. To wszystko, by w odpowiednim momencie zwołać zjazd i ogłosić się królem.<br/><br/>Grę możemy zakończyć na dwa sposoby. Posiadać żeton Princepsa (czyli takiego potentata) na koniec 6. rundy lub zwołać zjazd i się koronować przed czasem. Jak możemy to zrobić? Podczas rozgrywki będziemy przesuwać się na trzech torach — potęgi (zdobywać lub tracąc kontrolę nad grodami/miastami), poparcia ludu (wygrywając/przegrywając bitwy, zbierając podatki, kontrolując szranki, paląc podbite tereny i zagrywając odpowiednie karty) oraz poparcia kleru (zdobywając nienależące się nam obszary, budując opactwa oraz również zagrywając konkretne karty). Jak wskoczymy na najwyższe (lub równe) na dwóch z trzech torów — podczas akcji polityki możemy zwołać zjazd i przejąć żeton Princepsa (żeton pierwszego gracza i kandydata na króla, który definiuje kolejność i kierunek rozgrywki, a także rozstrzyga o wielu innych kwestiach), a jak będziemy na 10. pozycji na wszystkich torach, możemy się koronować i wygrać grę. Co oczywiście nie jest takie proste, jak mogłoby się wydawać.<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>Nasza pozycja na wspomnianych torach jest uzależniona od wielu kwestii i praktycznie odtworzyć z planszy, możemy jedynie tor potęgi, bo jest on zdefiniowany poprzez liczbę włości, które kontrolujemy. Pozostałych dwóch torów odtworzyć się nie da, a nasze żetony w bardzo prosty sposób mogą się przesunąć lub my o takiej zmianie pozycji możemy zwyczajnie zapomnieć. Jest to dość uciążliwe, ale trzeba mocno na te tory zwracać dużą uwagę, pilnować siebie i innych, bo zależy od nich nasze zwycięstwo. W moim odczuciu konieczne jest w wersji finalnej wykonanie dwuwarstwowej planszy torów, by zminimalizować ryzyko omyłkowego przesunięcia.<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>Na początku każdej rundy zaprogramujemy swoje akcje — trzy z sześciu możliwych. W trakcie rundy będziemy odsłaniać specjalne żetony i jednocześnie wykonywać zdefiniowane przez nie akcje. Nasi przeciwnicy nie będą mieli pojęcia, co zaprogramowaliśmy, a my podczas trwania rundy, oczywiście nie będziemy mogli zmienić naszych planów. <br/><br/><b>Jaki mamy akcje?<br/></b>Postęp — dobieramy tyle kafli postępu, który mamy okres (1-3). Są to swego rodzaju technologie, które usprawniają nasze możliwości w stosunku do podstawowych reguł i podstawowych akcji. Np. zwiększają przychód w akcji podatku, czy możliwości rekrutacji w akcji Wici, ale też np. blokują ruch przeciwnika na pierwszym polu naszych terenów lub zmieniają żeton akcji Postępu jako joker, którego możemy uruchomić jako dowolna inna akcja. Co do balansu nie będę się kłócić, ale mam wrażenie, że są wyraźnie lepsze kafle od innych i jeżeli się pojawią, to muszą zostać dobrane. <br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/7_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>Podatki — tracimy poparcie ludu i zarabiamy pieniądze. Pieniędzmi opłacamy rekrutacje, budowę oraz niektóre akcje z kart. Co ważne, kasa najpewniej będzie nam również potrzeba do negocjacji z innymi graczami, bo tylko nią możemy się wymieniać.<br/><br/>Wici — czyli rekrutacja. Możemy werbować piechotę i rycerzy. Ci pierwsi mają mniejszy zasięg i są słabsi, ale za to są za darmo, a to, jak wiemy, uczciwa cena.<br/><br/>Ruch — ruszamy wszystkimi jednostkami i wszczynamy bitwy (o nich za moment).<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/8_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>Budowa — lokujemy miasta (co zwiększa naszą potęgę) oraz budujemy dwa budynki z puli: zamek (zwiększa obronę), opactwo (zwiększa poparcie kleru) lub szranki (zwiększa poparcie ludu).<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/9_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>Polityka — tu mamy dwie opcje — albo dobieramy trzy karty i zostawiamy sobie dwie. Do wyboru mamy karty dworu (różne akcje jakby intryg) lub sąsiadów (pozwalają się nam ruszyć wojskami ościennych sił). <br/><br/>Początek rozgrywki bywa bardzo podobny — przynajmniej u nas tak było. Rekrutujemy jednostki, dobieramy żeton postępu i budujemy budynki z opcją zbierania podatków, ale rzadziej. Nie jest to nic złego, ale jest mocno zauważalne, szczególnie po kilku partiach z rzędu. <br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/10_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/><b>Na koń!<br/></b>Jest Area Control, to muszą być bitwy. Dochodzi do nich, gdy jedna armia spotka się z drugą. Co ciekawe, możemy się zgodzić (zapewne za odpowiednią opłatą) na przejazd obcych wojsk przez nasze ziemie, a nawet przez obszary z naszą armią. Bardzo fajne rozwiązanie. Jednak wróćmy do bitew.<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/11_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>Na początek liczymy siłę jednostek, by zważyć potencjał — piechurzy mają siłę i żywotność 1, a konni (rycerze i książę) 2. Grody, miasta i forty dodają 1-2 tarczy (obrony), które zbijają mieczyki (obrażenia). Następnie dorzucamy karty bitew (z opisem „przed bitwą”) i rzucamy kostkami, które mogą dodać nam mieczyki, tarcze lub ew. kradniemy złoto przeciwnikami (grabież wrogiego obozu podobno było standardem w tamtych latach). W międzyczasie ew. dorzucamy karty bitew (po rzucie kośćmi) i przewracamy zabite jednostki. Na koniec możemy dorzucić kolejny raz karty dodające miecze/tarcze (ze specjalnych ikonek), aby obronić jednostki, które poległy. Wtedy rozstrzygamy, kto wygrał, kto się musi wycofać i odrzucamy przewrócone figurki. Na koniec, jeśli spełniliśmy warunek, możemy dorzucić kolejny raz karty (po bitwie), które dają nam jakieś mocne bonusy — często przesuwają nas na torach lub dają złoto. Brzmi dość skomplikowanie, bo często pojawia się opcja wyłożenia kart, jednak są one dość dobrze opisane, kiedy jaką kartę możemy odpalić. Cała procedura mimo wszystko jest bardzo prosta, a potyczki są dość dynamiczne, a z pewnością szybkie.<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/12_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>Ciekawe jest to, że po wygranej bitwie zdobywamy poparcie ludu, tracimy poparcie kleru, chyba że wykupimy odpust za zajęcie nienależnych nam ziem, a na koniec musimy podjąć decyzję, czy zostawiamy miasto i budowlę, które przejęliśmy, czy jednak wpadliśmy tylko na moment i wszystko spalimy (licząc się z tym, że ani ludowi, ale klerowi się to nie spodoba). <br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/13_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>Tak jak wspomniałem, poszczególne Dzielnice są asymetryczne, a co za tym idzie w rozgrywce jest ten element stosunkowo mocno odczuwalny. Na całe szczęście, te różnice nie są na tyle wielkie, by od razu definiować nam styl gry, czy żebyśmy musieli nauczyć się wszystkich zdolności. Oczywiście, jest to pomocne, ale nie przesadzajmy – nie jest kluczowe. Z pewnością bardzo fajnie, że asymetria występuje, bo ją lubię i zawsze chętniej patrzę na tytuł, który chociaż minimalną ma wdrożoną..<br/><br/>Na początek każdego okresu będziemy musieli i pewnie chcieli rozstawiać swoje księżniczki. Mogą one pojawić się w trzech miejscach — w naszej stolicy (pozwalają na dobieranie kart), w stolicy przeciwnika (który będzie musiał przez to karty odrzucać) lub u Sąsiadów (o nich za chwilę) przez co ci, nie będą mogli nas najechać. Co ciekawe, zmieniając pozycję księżniczki, ta nie będzie mogła być rozstawiona w tym samym miejscu, gdzie była ostatnio.<br/><br/>Sąsiedzi, to nasi przyjaciele z zagranicy: Niemcy, Czesi, Węgrzy, Rusowie oraz dwa państwa pomorskie. Będą się uaktywniać po zagraniu kart Sąsiadów przed akcją Polityki. Można ich zblokować częściowo lub nawet całkowicie. Mogą mocno nam nabrudzić, przez co zawsze trzeba mieć jakieś wojsko zostawione na tyłach… no chyba, że mamy mocną kartę, by sparować agresję przeciwnika.<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/15_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>Najeźdźcy pojawić się u nas mogą za sprawą kart Dziejów. W przypadku Bałtów steruje nimi Princeps i najbardziej zagrożone jest Mazowsze…  jednak by zminimalizować zagrożenie z ich strony, można zaprosić Krzyżaków… którzy niestety mogą w kolejnych rundach nam popsuć plany jeszcze bardziej niż Prusacy i Litwini. Ciekawym rodzajem najeźdźcy jest Złota Orda, czyli jazda mongolska. Która przejedzie najpewniej przez całą Polskę. Steruje nimi każdy po kolei zaczynając od Princepsa. <br/><br/><b>Losowość, regrywalność, skalowanie i negatywna interakcja<br/></b>Losowości mamy całkiem sporo — głównie na kartach, które mogą zdecydować o wielu kwestiach, nawet wygranych partiach — warto dobierać ich dużo, chociaż wygrać można i bez nich — trudno, ale da radę. Oprócz tego los decyduje przy doborze kart dziejów, czyli wydarzeń, jak to zwykle bywa, ale również przy kostkach. Na szczęście nie są one aż tak ważne w bitwach, jak to przy k6 zwykle bywa, jednak podział wyników jest bardzo dobrze zaprojektowany, a dodatkowe miecze/tarcze są ważne, ale nie ma ich dużo. <br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/14_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>Regrywalność jest stosunkowo wysoka ze względu na asymetrię i wspomnianą losowość. Chociaż początek rozgrywki może wydawać się powtarzalny i często taki bywa, to jednak kolejne rundy już z pewnością do takich nie należą. <br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/16_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>Skalowanie to jeden z problematycznych tematów przy rozmowie o Principes. Niby możemy grać w mniejszej liczbie niż maksymalna, ale gra przez to wydaje się trochę dziwna. Jak któraś z dzielnic nie gra, pakujemy na nią więcej wojska, a podczas akcji Wici, Ruchu i Budowy będziemy mogli dodatkowo odpalić właśnie daną dzielnicę, by zaskoczyć przeciwnika lub uatrakcyjnić bliskie nam ziemie. Działa całkiem nieźle, ale jednak nie lubię do końca grać „za kogoś”, który bardziej przeszkadza, niż rzeczywiście gra. <br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/17_principes-768x511.jpg\"></div><br/>Jeżeli chodzi o negatywną interakcję, to jest jej dużo, jest ona wredna, można się zdradzać, nie dotrzymywać obietnic, bitwy są częste… Nie jest to gra dla miękiszownów. <br/><br/><b>Podsumowanie</b><br/>Principes już na tym etapie jest grą bardzo dobrą, a jak na prototyp jest przepiękna. Oczywiście można się przyczepić co do czytelności niektórych rozwiązań, ale gra jest w przygotowaniu i mam nadzieję, że zostanie to naprawione. Do rzeczy jednak. Mamy ciekawą grę strategiczną, zamykającą się w ok. 2 godzinach, która dostarcza wiele emocji. System programowania i odpalania akcji jest świetny, system śmierci książąt jest mega klimatyczny i stosunkowo wyjątkowy, a eliminacja gracza nie jest uciążliwa, bo odpala to koniec gry. Autor zastosował kilka mechanizmów najpewniej ze względu na klimat i pewnie z niektórych rzeczy powinien zrezygnować, ale już teraz myślę, że powinniście zainteresować się tą grą, bo już teraz zasługuje na wysoką ocenę. Szczerze polecam i mocno zachęcam!<br/><br/>Dziękujemy autorowi za przekazanie gry do recenzji.<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ocena3_spokojny-960x292-1-768x234.png\"></div><br/><br/>"

            "body": "Area control, negotiation, bluffing, and politics. Nothing more is needed to interest me in a game. When I learn that the author is Polish and that the game is set against a Polish background, I simply must check it out. That is exactly what happened with the prototype of the game Principes by Lew Sołowiej, for which funding on Gamefound is set to begin on May 20, 2025. I played my first session at the ALEgramy Festival in Gdańsk. It’s worth mentioning that I won that session – essentially by a fluke – which only increased my admiration for the game. Fortunately, a few weeks ago I received the prototype for testing under controlled conditions, with a lower dose of excitement and a few losses under my belt.<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1_principes.jpg\"></div><br/>Principes is an asymmetric strategic game for 2–4 players (a solo mode is in development). A game session should last around 2.5 hours. The gameplay is relatively complex, and when you add the matter of managing a board, I would say that only kids aged twelve or older should take a seat at the table.<br/><br/>The game is set during the fragmentation of Poland in the 13th century. You assume the roles of the heads of the various branches of the Piast dynasty, which at that time ruled the main regions – Lesser Poland, Greater Poland, Masovia, and Silesia. Each faction has its own special ability, a deck of Dukes (which, when exhausted, eliminates a player and triggers the game’s end process – each prince also has his own skill) as well as a fixed starting position and setup on the map.<br/><br/>The game is divided into three periods of two rounds each. These periods have several functions. First, at the beginning of each period, we deploy our princesses (more on them later). The Chronicle deck (i.e. events), which is built at the start of each period, depends on them (two cards are added per period – one per round), and the dukes from the current period die at its end, forcing us to choose those for the upcoming period. This reminds us of the passing of time and the need to take care of our leaders.<br/><br/>During the game, we will expand our estates, conquer new lands, strive to maintain control, and gain the support of both the populace and the clergy. All this is done so that at the right moment we can call a gathering and declare ourselves king.<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>The game can end in two ways. Either you hold the Princeps token (that is, a potentate) at the end of the 6th round, or you call a gathering and crown yourself early. How can we do that? During the game, our progress is tracked on three tracks – power (gaining or losing control over strongholds/cities), popular support (winning or losing battles, collecting taxes, controlling skirmishes, burning subjugated lands, and playing appropriate cards) and clerical support (acquiring territories not originally ours, building monasteries, and also playing certain cards). If we reach the top (or equal top) on two of the three tracks, then during a politics action we may call a gathering and claim the Princeps token (which also serves as the first player marker and the king candidate, defining the order and direction of the game and resolving many other issues). Moreover, if we reach 10 on all three tracks, we may crown ourselves and win the game. Of course, it isn’t as simple as it may seem.<br/><br/>Our position on the aforementioned tracks depends on many factors, and from the board, we can only easily reconstruct the power track, as it is defined by the number of estates we control. The other two tracks cannot be easily recreated, and our tokens can be moved rather easily, or we might simply forget about a change in position. This is rather troublesome, and one must pay close attention to these tracks, keeping an eye on oneself and others, since our victory depends on them. In my opinion, the final version should feature a two-layer board for the tracks to minimize the risk of accidental movements.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round we program our actions – three out of six possible options. During the round, we will reveal special tokens and simultaneously execute the actions defined by them. Our opponents will have no idea what actions we have programmed, and during the round, we certainly cannot change our plans.<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/><b>Which Actions Do We Have?</b><br/>Progress – We draw as many progress tiles as the number corresponding to the current period (1–3). These are a kind of technologies that enhance our capabilities relative to the basic rules and actions. For example, they might increase the revenue in a Tax action or the recruitment possibilities in a Recruitment, action, but also, for instance, block an opponent’s movement on the first tile of our lands, or transform the Progress action token into a joker that can be used as any other action. In terms of balance, I won’t argue too much, but it seems certain tiles are clearly superior and, if they appear, they must be picked up.<br/><br/><b>Taxes </b>– We lose popular support and earn money. Money is used to pay for recruitment, construction, and some card actions. Importantly, cash will likely be needed for negotiations with other players as it’s the only medium of exchange.<br/><br/><b>Recruitment</b>  – That is recruitment. We can recruit infantry and cavalry. The infantry have a shorter range and are weaker, but they come free of cost – which, as we know, is a fair price.<br/><br/><b>Movement </b>– We move all our units and initiate battles (more on these shortly).<br/><br/><b>Construction </b>– We establish cities (which increase our power) and build two buildings from a pool: a castle (increases defense), a monastery (increases clerical support) or skirmish lines (increase popular support).<br/><br/><b>Politics </b>– Here we have two options – either we draw three cards and keep two, choosing between court cards (which trigger various intrigue-like actions) or neighbors (allowing us to mobilize forces from adjacent powers).<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/7_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>The beginning of the game tends to be very similar – at least, that was my experience. We recruit units, draw a Progress token, and build buildings, sometimes with the option to collect taxes, albeit less often. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but it becomes quite noticeable, especially after a few sessions in a row.<br/><br/><b>Let’s Get to the Point!</b><br/>Since it is an Area Control game, battles are a must. They occur when one army encounters another. Interestingly, we can agree (presumably for a fee) to allow foreign troops to pass through our lands, even those areas occupied by our own army. A very neat solution. But let’s return to battles.<br/><br/>At the start, we count the strength of our units to assess potential – the infantry have a strength and vitality of 1, while cavalry (knights and dukes) have 2. Strongholds, cities, and forts add 1–2 shields (defense) that cancel out swords (damage). Then we add battle cards (marked “before battle”) and roll dice, which can add swords, shields, or even allow us to steal gold from opponents (looting an enemy camp was apparently standard in those days). In the meantime, additional battle cards (after dice rolling) can be played and defeated units are overturned. At the end, we may once again add cards that provide additional swords or shields (from special icons) to defend fallen units. Then we resolve who wins, who must retreat, and discard the toppled figures. Finally, if conditions are met, we may add another round of cards (after the battle) that give us potent bonuses – often moving us along the tracks or awarding gold. It sounds rather complicated because of all the card play options, but they are quite well explained regarding when each card can be activated. Overall, the procedure is quite simple, and skirmishes are dynamic and, most importantly, fast.<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/9_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/>It is interesting that after a victorious battle we gain popular support and lose clerical support, unless we buy an indulgence for occupying lands that are not rightfully ours. In the end, we must also decide whether to keep the city and building we captured or if we simply made a brief incursion and burn everything (bearing in mind that neither the populace nor the clergy will approve).<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the individual regions are asymmetric, and as a result, this element is quite strongly felt in the gameplay. Fortunately, these differences are not so great as to immediately define your play style or force you to learn every single ability. Of course, it helps, but let’s not overdo it – it isn’t key. It is certainly very nice that asymmetry is present because I like it and I always pay more attention to a title that implements it even minimally.<br/><br/>At the start of each period, we will have (and probably want) to deploy our princesses. They can appear in three locations – in our own capital (allowing us to draw cards), in an opponent’s capital (forcing them to discard cards), or at the Neighbors (more on them shortly), so that they cannot invade us. Interestingly, when changing the princess’s position, she cannot be deployed in the same spot as the previous round.<br/><br/>Neighbors are our foreign friends: Germans, Czechs, Hungarians, Russians, and two Pomeranian states. They will be activated by playing Neighbors cards before a Politics action. They can be partially or even completely blocked. They can cause us significant trouble, so it is always wise to keep some troops in reserve… unless we have a strong card to counter an opponent’s aggression.<br/><br/>Invaders can appear in our lands via Chronicle cards. In the case of the Balts, they are led by a Princeps, and Masovia is the most threatened… however, to minimize the threat, you can invite the Teutonic Knights… who, unfortunately, in subsequent rounds, might spoil our plans even more than the Prussians or Lithuanians. An interesting type of invader is the Golden Horde, that is, the Mongol rider. They will probably ride through all of Poland. They are led in turn by each player starting with the Princeps.<br/><br/><b>Randomness, Replayability, Scaling, and Negative Interaction</b><br/>There is a fair amount of randomness – primarily in the cards, which can decide many matters, even the outcome of games – so it is worth drawing plenty of them, although you can win without them; it’s difficult, but possible. In addition, chance plays a role when drawing Chronicle cards, as is usually the case, and when rolling dice. Fortunately, the impact of dice in battles isn’t as significant as with a six-sided die typically would be; the distribution of results is very well designed, and while additional swords/shields are important, there aren’t many of them.<br/><br/><b>Replayability </b>is relatively high due to the asymmetry and the aforementioned randomness. Although the start of the game might seem repetitive – and it often is – subsequent rounds certainly break away from that pattern.<br/><br/><b>Scaling </b>is one of the problematic topics when discussing Principes. Sure, you can play with fewer than the maximum number of players, but the game then feels a bit strange. If one of the regions is not in play, you end up concentrating more troops on it, and during the Recruitment , Movement, and Construction actions, you might additionally activate that region to surprise an opponent or spice up your own territories. It works quite well, but I’m not entirely fond of playing “on behalf of someone” who interferes more than actually playing.<br/><br/>When it comes to negative interaction, there is plenty: it’s nasty, with possibilities for betrayal, breaking promises, and frequent battles… This is not a game for the faint-hearted.<br/><div><img border=0 src=\"https://angryboardgamer.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/13_principes-595x396.jpg\"></div><br/><b>Summary</b><br/>Even in its current state, Principes is a very good game, and for a prototype, it’s absolutely beautiful. Of course, one could nitpick regarding the clarity of some solutions, but the game is still in preparation and I hope these issues will be resolved. Bottom line: we have an intriguing strategic game, wrapping up in about 2 hours, that delivers plenty of excitement. The system of programming and executing actions is excellent, the system of the dukes’ demise is extremely atmospheric and rather unique, and player elimination isn’t troublesome since it triggers the game’s end. The author has introduced several mechanisms likely for thematic reasons, and perhaps should abandon some, but I already think you should take an interest in this game because it already deserves a high rating. I sincerely recommend it and encourage you to check it out!"

            "body": "Foxy is a memory game by @gateongames, that lasts only 20 turns, or actually 20 cards. It is super easy to explain, but super difficult!! It's a memory game... and my memory is ... well ... not that great 🤭<br/><br/>Each turn you flip a card and you count the number of animals on the card and write that down on your board. However! You also have to add up the number of how many times these animals have already been seen on previous cards 🥸 luckily in a solo game the turns go by fast (about 5 mins?), and as you flip the cards quite fast, there is a good chance you still remember the animals. However, in a multiplayer game, turns can go slower because people want to think about what they saw, and you will start to forget 😱<br/><br/>Also, don't play two games or more in a row, because you won't be able to remember if you saw the bunny already 2 times? Or was that in the previous game? 🤔<br/>When Foxy comes out in play, you have to write down how many different animals you saw until that moment (excluding Foxy). Once per game, on that turn itself, you can circle a number and -if correct- you get double the points at the end of the game. But if you're wrong... You get 0 points instead 😣<br/><br/>This game reminds me of Deja Vu, where cards are flipped over and when you see an icon for the second time, you have to grab the token. It's quite stressful because if 3 people remember at the same time, all hands go for that same token 😅<br/><br/>This is a more child friendly version, and for people who want to play more relaxed games. It is a great filler game, to start up the game night or to cool down your brain. Also, the drawings are super cute!! There is a cat underwater wearing an astronaut suit 🥰 and also the comic of the fox and the bunnies, SO CUTE 😍🥰♥️"

For Christmas he wanted the famous deerstalker, so I thought it would be fun to pair it with this game. <br/>We played it all together and finished it today. We really loved the narration, as the story and the characters were incredibly well thought and written. The little moments where the characters describe the world as they see it through their eyes are little gems. <br/>We finished only today as he was dreading to solve the last case and not to be part of the story any more. So obviously today as he was really sad for the end of the game and angry at one particular animal, he wondered if there would ever be an expansion or at least some books set in this universe. <br/>I hope it will happen, we really enjoyed this story. He still says things like \"I'm like Rossetti now\". Or while cleaning the room \"we need Edna here\", we hope to meet them again. <br/>The game runs smoothly, by the way and every choice makes sense."

From the moment you see that cover art whispering “harmony with nature,” you know you’re in for a calm, satisfying experience.<br/><br/>When you sit down to play, you find a serene puzzle… until that perfect combo of salmon tokens lands on the board. You know it isn’t actually the optimal play for your wife, but somehow she snags that salmon first and you realize even indirect competition can sting. Ten seconds later the frustation disappears as you realize there’s always another tile waiting. The game is smart enough to steer you clear of truly dead-end draws, so you never feel hopelessly stuck.<br/><br/><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8885762\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2W10qcyIQSKmbk6_zeY78A__small/img/DcxNzWaRFpTq47PqvCZ5BIcJoMo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8885762.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><br/><br/>Components get top marks from the tarot-sized cards, the high quality habitat tiles to the chunky animal tokens.  My only nitpick? The insert is terrible. I still can’t figure out the “correct” way to pack it all away—strangely ironic for a game where everything else fits so perfectly.<br/><br/>The gameplay is every bit as satisfying as expected. Matching terrain types and placing animals feels intuitive, yet there’s enough depth in planning your cascades to keep you hooked for hours. It’s not going to replace your all-time favorite, but it’s the perfect Sunday-afternoon pick-up-and-play that never overstays its welcome.<br/><br/>What really surprised me, though, is the replayability. You’d think a family-oriented puzzle would go stale fast, but the ever-shifting scoring cards for each animal ensure you’re always chasing a fresh goal. No two games ever feel the same.<br/><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Presentation - 10<br/>Engagement - 7<br/>Gameplay - 9<br/>Value - 8<br/><br/>&gt; Final Score: 8.5 / 10<br/><br/><br/><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8885756\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AAp-xREN-LX5vpo7JkTL-A__small/img/loud1RQprWxQy2s7U2g_zF4SLSg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8885756.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Wrap-Up:<br/>Cascadia isn’t an earth-shattering epic, but it’s the ideal mood-maker—perfect for a rainy Sunday or dialing down the tension after a cut-throat session.

Sometimes shape matters, sometimes it doesn't. Salmon is already restricted in that the runs only count as long as each doesn't connect to more than 2 others. Hawks are even more \"goofy\" in how they have to sight each other and be so far away. It is just what gives variety to the scoring and how you have to plan for multiple things to maximize placement for scoring. <br/><br/><font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>Secondly,  CARD E is literally titled Zig-Zag run, so wouldn't that indicate that it has to be in a zig-zag shape?</i></div></div></font><br/>Typically names are just thematic. What is important is the clarifications which for this card says must match exact shape - or the mirror of. So yes, it does need to be in a zig-zag shape."

The example shows a group of 2 Hawks, 3 Elk, 3 Foxes, and 6 Bears. According to the chart on the card, the Hawks will score 3 points for having a group size of \"2\", while the other three groups will score 5 points each for having a group size of \"3+\". Note that the group of 6 Bears falls into the category of \"group size of 3+ scores 5 Points\" so the Bears will only score 5 points even though there are 6 of them in the group.<br/><br/>As noted in a previous reply above, if the Bears had been separated into two different non-adjacent groups of 3 Bears each, then *both* of those groups would have scored 5 points each.<br/><br/>The correct answer is 18.<br/><br/>Cheers!"

You’ll have your work cut out for you – proper urban planning is required to lay out the parks, waterfront, buildings, and special features to meet all of their requirements.

No free copy was provided for review, and I’ve had no contact with the publisher regarding this game. All opinions contained within are my own unbiased thoughts.</i><br/><br/><b>Game Overview</b><br/><br/>There are some games out there where I hear some really good word-of-mouth recommendations for them and I immediately seek out a copy; or I come across a well-written review that makes it sound right up my alley and I know I need to go try it out. Cities, for me, was not one of these cases. I was wandering around PAX Unplugged 2024 with a group of friends, and after a long day of walking around and trying to see everything, we really just wanted to find an open table in the demo area where we could just all sit down and play a game together without waiting. A group had just finished playing a game and stood up, so we quickly scooted into the open seats without even really knowing what we sat down for. And there in front of us was…Cities, a game none of us had ever heard about before sitting down.<br/><br/>Now, if you’re going to sit down at a table to play an unknown board game and someone is going to randomly throw a box in front of you, you’re probably not doing so bad if you look forward and see Phil Walker-Harding’s name on the box as one of the designers. He has dozens of game designs under his belt, including a slew of well-known and well-rated titles such as Sushi Go, Gizmos, Imhotep, and many others. So, our gamble to just sit at a random table to relax for a bit was already looking like it may down out better than we had planned.<br/><br/>Released in 2024, Cities is Steve Finn and PWH’s most recent game as of the time of me writing this review. As you may suspect from the start of my review or the picture on the cover of the box, the theme of this one has you acting as an urban planner, where you and your fellow opponents are each designing your own 3x3 tile landscape, and placing different components on top to help achieve the highest final score. The main way you will achieve this is by taking turns drafting different city tiles, scoring cards, building pieces, and feature tiles, and then strategically placing them on your own personal city landscape. The game also comes with 8 different “cities” to play in; each game you will choose one city to play (randomly or by choice), and depending on which one you select, there will be different bonuses you can earn for adding certain design elements. For example, if you choose New York City, one of the bonus design elements is being the first person to build a very large park (think Central Park) or multiple very tall buildings. Likewise, if you choose Rio De Janeiro, you’re rewarded for building an outstanding waterfront, along with very colorful buildings of varied heights.<br/><br/><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8824489\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2td93prInjsY7n4HU4h25A__small/img/t-E1u462Uj4BWbW4BV27s9I-TSE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8824489.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><i>Working on my own little New York City neighborhood</i><br/><br/>I won’t rehash all of the details of the full rulebook, but a typical 4-player game plays like this:<br/><br/><b>1)</b> Each player starts with one randomly selected starting city tile. Each city tile in the game has four spaces on it, which provide either parks, waterfront, or a space to construct buildings or other special features.<br/><b>2)</b>The board is set up so that there are four different rows of items. The top row contains four rule cards, the next row contains four city tiles, followed by a row that contains 4 groups of feature tiles, and then lastly a row containing four groups of various numbers of building pieces.<br/><b>3)</b>Players take turns drafting these items one by one as play moves clockwise. The catch is, in each round, you can only draft ONE item from each of the four rows. So once a player has chosen the city tile they want, for example, you know that they can not choose another item in that column for the rest of this turn. This helps players adjust their priorities for the items they want to draft the most as play moves onwards. Drafting continues until all 16 groups of items are gone (meaning each player has chosen four times). Items that are drafted must be played IMMEDIATELY – you cannot save an item to be placed later, or move anything after the fact. So for example, if you draft a red building piece, but have no proper spot to play it – it is just discarded from the game.<br/><b>4)</b>After this, the game board is reset with new randomly drawn groups of tiles/cards/etc, and the player who chose the star token (which comes along with the least valuable building piece spot each turn) gets to go first on the next round.<br/><br/><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8824490\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2I-uyTqXziPt9AERnO8rEw__small/img/qJVyxbGVLgW5_l8u9WAaRFYRSAc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8824490.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><i>All set up and ready to go</i><br/><br/>There are 8 rounds played in total in a 3 or 4 player game, ending with each player having exactly a 3x3 grid of city tiles in front of them as the game ends (it is required to build in this shape). Scoring happens in four different ways – you can complete the “city achievements” specific to whichever city scenario you are playing, you can build combinations of certain features in your water or park spaces, you can build monuments in your city that score points, and lastly you score based on the rules in the scoring cards you drafted during the game and how they apply to your specific city design.<br/><br/><b>My Thoughts</b><br/><br/>I’ll start off right up front by saying that I love this game, and I’ve also found that everyone I have shared it with has loved it as well. You know those games where every time they hit your table, someone is pulling out their phone by the end of it to order their own copy of the game? Cities is one of those for my gaming group.<br/><br/>One of the coolest parts about Cities is the design of the scoring system. Part of the scoring is defined by fixed parameters shared by all players – you are racing to see who can complete the city achievements first (the earlier you satisfy the requirements for each achievement, the more points you get from it). Everyone is also competing on the same playing field to set up different features in their parks and waterfront areas. But the majority of points come from the rule cards you draft along the way. Sometimes you get lucky and draft a rule card that fits your current build very well, but other times you can find yourself getting stuck with one that doesn’t score you any points yet, and you have to make some adjustments in future rounds to help make the rule card score. This system gives the game a very asymmetric feeling, where every player is working to alter their own scoring system to give themselves the best chance to win. It also creates an additional layer of depth to the game by forcing you to think about playing defense; sometimes you draft a rule card because it denies an opponent more points than a different card may have gained you.<br/><br/><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8824492\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HF5U0eyJA9Vq-tfyURPSKg__small/img/JkvliEVIiAaSyFJtEDArP14njv4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8824492.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><i>Some sample rule cards from the game</i><br/><br/>From the standpoint of the components themselves, Cities is more than adequate. The building pieces (which never stack more than 4 units high) are made out of very sturdy plastic, and are designed in a way that they are very stable when stacked; if an energetic friend bumps into the table a little too hard, it’s still very unlikely that these will topple over or go flying anywhere. It comes with a nice drawstring canvas bag to blind draw the building components out of, and everything else in the game that is made of cardboard is more than ample thickness and unlikely to cause any problems. There’s nothing overly premium anywhere, but they did find the right balance of quality to the point that no one will have any complaints.<br/><br/>I’ve played Cities at all 3 possible player counts. It plays best at the 4-player count, but that being said it’s still a great game at both 2 and 3 players (I do wish they had included a solo mode though!). One recommendation I have – if you play this game at a 2-player count, you can optionally alter the rules to build out a 3x5 grid instead of a 3x3 grid – I’d highly recommend this at 2 players, otherwise the game is far too short for anyone to really see through any complex strategy decisions.<br/><br/>There aren’t many things about this game I dislike, but if I had to pick something, it’s that there is a *slight* issue in the balance of the scoring options. After registering about 20 plays on this game with varied groups of opponents, I think I can confidently say that score gained by the rule cards you draft really overpowers the other avenues of scoring in the game. If you’re ever in a tight spot where drafting one thing would get you closer to a city achievement, but another item would benefit you more based on the rule cards you’ve picked, it almost always makes sense to go with the rule card option. With near 100% consistency, we’ve seen the player that does the best from their own sets of rules emerge as the winner, even if they ignored most of the city achievements. The other thing I’d point out – while I love the 8 included cities to play with, I do wish they either included more, or would make an expansion for this with some new cities to use. It seems like it would be really simple to do, and might add a ton of additional replayability to this title.<br/><br/><b>Verdict:</b><br/><br/>Cities gets my absolute highest recommendation, I have yet to play a round of this game that hasn't been a complete joy. PWH, Steve Finn, and Devir have a winner on their hands with this game – I’d highly recommend this to anyone who loves drafting games, it’s just overall a clever, smooth game design.<br/><br/><b>Likes:</b><br/>- “Rule Card” scoring system adds a ton of depth and a great asymmetric feel<br/>- Super smooth gameplay, very easy to teach<br/>- Great design to the city building pieces to make them very stable to stack<br/>- Includes 8 different “cities” to use for different building guidelines; adds a ton of replayability<br/>- Seriously, I think nearly every single person I’ve shown this game to in person has ended up buying it<br/><br/><b>Dislikes:</b><br/>- Scoring methods could use a little better balancing (rule cards seem to outscore everything else)<br/>- Would be a great candidate for an expansion involving more cities to use!"

            "body": "Dawn of Mankind is part of a new trend of smaller box games with a lot of crunch to them, in the same vein as the Epic and Age of _ series.  It is modestly priced and comes in a smaller box, though not as small as the aforementioned series.  Our group plays games regularly with Root, Hansa Teutanica, Cthulhu Wars, and Beyond the Sun being among our favorites.  This week I brought this gem to the table.<br/><br/>Presentation-<br/>The art is simple, but gets the job done.  I have heard people complain about the meeple markers, but honestly every item is both a specific shape and color to denote its role in the game.  Once you understand their symbol system, visual analysis of the board is very easy and straightforward.  The art, while muted, fits the theme very well of your tribe spreading out into the world to advance its knowledge, gather food, and expand.  It also has a very modest table footprint compared to many similar games, being both easier to organize and more compact during play than many of these other smaller gamebox games.<br/><br/>Mechanics-<br/>This is where the game excels.  It is a worker placement, but with constant bumping of your tribe as each player competes for important action.  The rounds are continuous, meaning no clean up phase after X workers are placed or some such, just constant actions being taken with a player occasionally resting to free up workers strategically.  This has two major impacts on the game, both positive.  First, there is almost no down time in this game, even with five players.  Second, more workers does not translate into more action economy, simply more board presence and options.  This second one is key, because one issue many worker placement games have is if one player builds up a bunch of workers early before the others they have an overwhelming action advantage.  In this game, you will still want workers so that you can have more options and be bumped more often, but they are not essential to remain competitive, at least not directly.  Infact, in larger games you will see players tone down how many of their workers are brought into play just to avoid having to bump constantly.  It is very reminiscent of Beyond the Sun in this manner.<br/><br/>What is bumping?  Well when you move a worker from a ready area (organized into lanes of more powerful actions) to an action space where another player's worker already exists, that player gets moved up into the next (and more advanced) ready space, freeing it up to take more powerful actions.  It sounds competitive and chaotic, and on some levels it is, but really it just drives the pace of the game by encouraging players to balance their worker supply and bumping.  The idea situation is to be in a constant state of being bumped and taking actions, minimizing how often you need to rest.  It works very well and prevents the whole \"I am blocked out of anything\" situation a lot of other Worker Placement games suffer.  Here, you can always take the action, but it may benefit an opponent.  In this way, players are always doing something they want to develop their game state, comparable to games like Seven Wonders and Magna Roma, and not feeling trapped into dead turns.<br/><br/>Balancing this are a touch of resource management and art cards.  Most actions, including the Art cards, require resources to activate.  Thus you cannot simply focus on scoring points but must also be sure to constantly be gathering resources to sustain your scoring efforts.  The art cards are essentially scoring cards for workers that age out with numerous options and twists to their value.  The serve as one of the primary random elements in the game, since they are drawn at random and replaced as completed.  The art cards are pricey enough to force real choices, but score enough to make them all desirable options if you can manage your resources to benefit from them.  They are arguably the strongest aspect of the scoring mechanisms in this game.<br/><br/>Scoring is pretty straightforward, drawing tokens for your points as you go and then you can hide your current total if you wish.  If a player reaches 60, the game ends immediately and a few bonus points (mostly based on techs you gain and remaining resources) are scored.  In practice, the player ending the game tends to win since the other end game bonus points are modest, which is one of my main criticisms of the game.  People with good memory will know the game state, but anyone else is in the dark and will be caught off guard by the game ending.  I also think the techs need to have more post game value to justify the effort needed to secure them, particularly in higher player count games.  Most of our games were won by people just resourcing and landing on the biggest VP spaces repeatedly and ignoring the techs all together.  I feel like making the end game tech and resource points worth maybe double would open up some more play options beyond \"I hit the 10VP square early and often\".  I think hiding the points is kind of silly too and maybe they should have gone with a token draw system for rewards where you draw X tokens and keep them hidden.  Reason being, as someone with a good memory I knew how many points everyone had at all times.  My wife, who is good at board games but not as good at memorization, struggled to track the game state.<br/><br/>Overall-<br/>Those minor issues with scoring aside, I recommend this game strongly for anyone who likes WP games but hates action economy being a dominant element.  If you like low downtime fast paced games, this will also sit well with your group.  Finally, If you like Euro games of low complexity or are interested in simply trying a Euro style game for the first time, this is probably the best game you could choose to fit that role.  Its simple enough to not overwhelm, requiring no rulebook referencing once setup is complete.  But the strategy is pretty deep and player interaction is present without it being hyper competitive.  I consider it a simpler more muted version of Beyond the Sun, which I mean as very high praise.  Thanks to the randomization of action tiles and art cards, it also has a very high degree of replayability, something other Worker Placement games struggle to achieve.  It is also very fast to set up, play, and pack up, moreso than any comparable game.<br/><br/>My rating for this game if I had to assign a number would be a 9.5 out of 10, with only the scoring balance holding it back from perfection."
