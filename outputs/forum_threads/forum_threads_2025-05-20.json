            "body": "I played a multiplayer game against Klaw. This is what happened during a villain attack:<br/>- Player A hero is attacked and does not defend.<br/>- First revealed boost card is sonic boom (boost ability = if this activation deals damage to <b>you</b>, exhaust your hero).<br/>- On the second boost card with boost icons, player B plays preemptive strike.<br/>- As this is a defense event, player B hero becomes the defender.<br/>- the attack deals damage to player B hero.<br/><br/>Is player B hero exhausted?<br/><br/>The boost effect is a delayed effect, so I wonder if \"you\" refers to the target when the boost card was revealed (hero A, who was not dealt damage), or to the target when the delayed effect resolves (hero B) ?<br/><br/>My doubt comes in particular from what is said in the RRG FAQ, about lasting effect and Ultron. Based on the same explanation, I would say that B is not exhausted?<br/><br/><i>Q: If Ultron’s attack is defended by a player other than the one who was attacked, does Ultron get +1 ATK for each Drone minion engaged with the defending player or the player Ultron initiated the attack against?<br/>A: Ultron’s ability has already resolved before defenders are declared, <b>creating a lasting effect that refers to the original target of the attack</b>. The bonus to Ultron’s ATK is based on the number of Drone minions engaged with the player Ultron initiated the attack against.</i>"

            "body": "<b><u><center>Curation Crew - Spider-Woman, Adam Warlock, and Kang</center></u></b><br/>Welcome back to Curation Crew, the series that works to highlight the best content Marvel Champions has to offer in an effort to downsize and curate a more compact collection. This week, we're taking a look at two of the most unique heroes when it comes to deck-building and what their respective freedoms and limitations offer.<br/><br/><center><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8893096\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0BXuCYAamLfdH7tTg5x8rQ__small/img/FpKJ1tmPxfJkTLokN1hyfvHVPi4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8893096.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><b>Theme:</b> 5/5<br/>Spider-Woman is a hero that has taken on a wide variety of roles over the course of her life, both in terms of the jobs she's worked and the organizations she's worked with. So the idea of her having cards in her kit from all 4 Aspects is a solid representation of this idea while tying into some fun mechanics. Each of her Aspect cards ties into a particular superpower she has access to, which I really appreciate, with Self-Propelled Glide working similarly while highlighting how it's not tied to any specific Aspect but ties her various tools together. Captain Marvel is her best friend, so she's an excellent include as the signature ally as well. The only real thematic failings here are Finesse and Jessica's Apartment, both feeling thematically empty, though they are understandable additions from a mechanical perspective. As a whole, though, I think this deck does great work presenting the character, especially for those who may be unfamiliar with her.<br/><br/><b>Player Choice:</b> 5/5<br/>Spider-Woman is one of the strongest heroes in the game when it comes to choices, as you're flush with interesting decisions every turn. For one, you had to decide which Aspect cards you want to play turn-to-turn, since you're incentivized to play as many Aspects as possible to bump up your core stats. But is it more valuable for you to play a couple of Protection cards and build up your board state or your health over your stats? And since your stat buffs carry into the villain phase, do you want to defend this turn but start your next turn exhausted, not necessarily able to capitalize on your buffed stats? Maybe you see your hand is flush with 1 Aspect, so you DEF because you know your stats will be low next turn regardless.<br/><br/>Then there's the consideration of spending some time in Alter-Ego, giving you insight into the villain's plans by peeking at the villain deck while giving you access to extra card draw via your Apartment. Not just extra card draw, you're scrying for the Aspect card of your choice, which can be huge for setting up your next turn.<br/><br/>And that's not touching on the wide variety of things your deck can do; you can shut down the villain with a stun and confuse, you can heal yourself and gain a tough, all the while having affordable but effective bursts of damage and thwarting, and your stat boosts means you can pivot to accomplish just about any task asked of you. Spider-Woman really is a hero you can rely on to help with just about anything you set your mind to.<br/><br/><b>Gameplay Loop:</b> 5/5<br/>From turn 1, Spider-Woman is able to enter the fray swinging, with a handful of cards that allows you to let loose and gives you some strong momentum to push that advantage throughout the game. She's constantly fueled by the various cards she plays, commonly events, and while her permanents help her engine, they are by no means mandatory to allow her to flow. And once she does get them in play, Spider-Woman is getting a bunch of extra cards and paying them off without a second thought, giving her plenty of ways to pivot as needed. Likely her biggest weaknesses are status effects and exhaustions to her hero form, but these don't slow her down as much as you would expect; because of how many events you play each turn, you are likely able to decide whether your exhaust or spend a card to rip a status card. And while being exhausted can turn off an exciting turn, you can also leverage your stats towards DEF that round or take the opportunity to flip down and take advantage of your stellar Alter-Ego effects.<br/><br/><b>Deckbuilding:</b> 5/5<br/>As you might expect, Spider-Woman gets top marks in this category, able to leverage 2 different Aspects simultaneously. She has some limitations in that she must have an equal number of cards from each, and she generally favors low-cost cards to synergize with her growing stat-line. This also can limit the number of Basic cards she has access to, since she really wants to play Aspect cards whenever possible. All of these caveats don't hold her back from being an absolute dream when it comes to deck-construction, with every card added to the overall pool offering more options for her to consider. What combination of Aspects you choose to use can dramatically change how she plays, and the synergies you find across those Aspects can be as if not more rewarding than what synergizes you find with her core cards.<br/><br/><b>Total:</b> 20/20<br/><b>Status:</b> In the Curation<br/>Spider-Woman is a masterclass of design and everything I look for from a hero, offering many ways to approach the game, regardless of what vastly different combinations of Aspects you choose. She allows for interesting decisions which are facilitated by an engine that allows her to get going from turn one and ways to work around her few weaknesses, meaning she rarely if ever feels like she has a bad turn. She's a hero that I will always love to pilot and am glad to have in my collection.<br/><center>______________________________________________________</center><br/><br/><center><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8893167\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F8BWYu0iFzoUjQUX84GVyg__small/img/u6j9pGtA0kfWuLukpbgG0934e1g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8893167.jpg\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><b>Theme:</b> 2/5<br/>Adam Warlock being a being of immense power and unique physiology, has a plethora of abilities that he has access to, which is a daunting task to represent within the framework of a game like this. However, I don't think that how he is presented is particularly successful, with many of his abilities feeling vague and generic in nature. His ability to get various boosts to his events by discarding cards off of his deck doesn't feel especially thematic to leveraging his abilities, although I guess you could argue he's digging deep and using his inner energy to fuel his effects. His permanents feel similarly basic, with his staff and cape not really relating to the effects they provide, although I think this is a function of design in the earlier days of Marvel Champions. His core gimmick is likely the best representation of his overall power kit, despite how it feels a little generic in use in terms of flavor. Much of his kit generally just feels mechanical, which is a shame but also kind of understandable seeing as they selected a character that's, in my opinion, hard to represent well.<br/><br/><b>Player Choice:</b> 2/5<br/>Adam is a funky character when it comes to player choice. On the one hand, he desperately needs most of his permanent cards in play as soon as possible to function, namely his copies of Cosmic Awareness and Soul World, although his Staff and Cape definitely help a lot as well. This means that his deck can feel very linear when he's trying to set up, but can just as easily be disrupted by how quickly he can mill his deck. And while he has ways of returning cards to his hand from his discard pile, he can mill those away just as easily, meaning there's no guarantee of setting up effectively or in a timely manner. On the other hand, Adam can have some decent decisions when it comes to his core ability, allowing him to discard an Aspect card for an effect. That being said, this choice can feel vary limited as well; you are limited by what Aspect cards you drew into, whether or not that effect does anything to help, and whether or not that's a card you need to play rather than spend, meaning that this can feel just as limited. With many of the deck write-ups I've observed for Adam, it's commonly the Aspect cards that search for particular cards that offer the most interesting choices, with his own cards feeling more straightforward in nature.<br/><br/><b>Gameplay Loop:</b> 2/5<br/>As was suggested above, Adam can have a really hard time setting up, and what he has access to from the start doesn't offer a ton of options when he's building his engine. His stat line is below average, whether or not he can make a decent impact on the board can depend on the Aspect cards you've drawn, and you can end up discarding your key cards and make it harder to get them in play. Most decks are built around helping Adam make up for his weaknesses rather than synergizing with what he can already do, which I think highlights how he's a tough hero to pilot and generally bats below the curve when it comes to performance.<br/><br/><b>Deckbuilding:</b> 2/5<br/>So, on the one hand, Adam has access to all Aspects simultaneously, giving him unprecedented access to nearly any card in the pool. However, he can only have 1 copy of any cards he adds, and he has to have an equal number of cards across the 4 core Aspects, which usually means 4 or 5 cards per Aspect depending on how many Basic cards you want to include. All of this lends Adam to being more restrictive than he is freeing when it comes to how he can approach the game. On top of this, there are certain cards that you always need to include to give him a chance at success. The most obvious of these are the 4 spell cards he came with, one from each Aspect that are powerful, cheap, and burns cards out of his deck in order to fuel their effects. Beyond this, there's also allies, as Adam really needs allies to help both carry him in the early game and gives valid targets to Summoning Spell (one of the aforementioned spell cards), despite how Pip the Troll is weirdly anti-synergistic to that combo that he needs to leverage.<br/><br/>All of this is to say that in spite of how much flexibility Adam has, he struggles to build effective decks because of the limitations imposed on him. There are a handful of great decks that stand out from the pack, but a majority of them are ally focused and feature many of the same allies that allows him to dig for cards to help his otherwise weak economy.<br/><br/><b>Total:</b> 8/20<br/><b>Status:</b> Not in the Curation<br/>While Adam Warlock is a very unique character in terms of how he operates, he is also an incredibly restrictive and at times frustrating character to both build a deck for and pilot. You're often at the whim of your deck, and it can feel like a slog to actually engage with the game in meaningful ways until you get enough of your core cards in play to offer forward momentum. In the late game, he can be a powerhouse, but with harder villains you have a good chance of losing well before that becomes a reality.<br/><center>______________________________________________________</center><br/><br/><center><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8893387\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MInyj1c2Pqy0EXArI-8gcg__small/img/23Gm-e6yAbtymuff-RqCsIJ6lMU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8893387.png\" border=0></a></div></center><br/><b>Theme:</b> 5/5<br/>Being the master of time, Kang has a lot of wonky and entertaining ways to mess with the players, taking them through a journey that will test their will to survive. Flooding the board with Obligations, Kang will try to weigh down players with the many ways that he has manipulated the time stream in an effort to slow down his opposition, all the while building up his armada of ships to make his victory assured. Midway through the game, he'll throw his enemies up against various versions of himself to buy himself some time, separating them from one another so they are unable to coordinate as a team. And when that fails, he'll use overwhelming force to try and kill his enemies and win the day. This scenario as a whole is a masterclass of theme and is a highlight of the game in my opinion.<br/><br/><b>Difficulty:</b> 5/5<br/>Kang offers an excellent level of difficulty for players to grapple with, forcing players to deal with a cavalcade of effects if they have any chance of surviving. Simply forcing the players to split up for a time and fight their own battles can be a huge test for certain heroes who rely on their teammates to support them. That coupled with his Obligations, which can be hard to manage if enough of them come out at once, and Kang's powerful stats and constant pressure, makes him a force to be reckoned with. To be clear, he certainly isn't the most difficult villain, but his difficulty feels like it's at a perfect mark of tough enough without feeling overwhelming.<br/><br/><b>Gameplay Loop:</b> 3/5<br/>In order to facilitate all this theme, there's a lot of stuff to constantly be monitoring and adjusting mid-game. Players have to consider how they want Kang to activate against them, which can be forgotten from time to time. There's also the huge mid-game shift to playing solo for a time before shifting back to team play, as well as any of the set aside side schemes the players cultivate during that phase. It's a lot of moving pieces that have to be managed, which can make the scenario feel a little tiring to play through.<br/><br/><b>Replayability:</b> 2/5<br/>Due to how time-intensive this fight can be mixed with how much the players have to manage during the game, and this is very much a \"sometimes food,\" a scenario I enjoy returning to once every year or so. While it can be a lot of fun, you have to be in the right mood to fight him, otherwise you may find yourself flopping over as the fight comes to a close.<br/><br/><b>Total:</b> 15/20<br/><b>Status:</b> In the Curation<br/>While Kang is a villain I will revisit sparingly, when I'm in the mood for his unique brand, he's one of the best baddies the game has to offer, with some excellent flavor supporting a strong mechanical backbone. He was the first of the \"narrative\" villains and sets a bar for creating a cinematic experience for players, with an epic scope that few villains have attempted since.<br/><center>______________________________________________________</center><br/><br/>As always, I'd love to hear what you have to say about these characters. What's your favorite combo of Aspects for Spider-Woman? Where have you found the best success with Adam Warlock? And how often do you find yourself returning to Kang? Thanks as always for taking the time to read, and I look forward to talking with you again soon."

Aggression & Justice is my preferred aspect combo since I can deal with just about anything that way (and it matches her suit). Skilled Strike is a must!

            "body": "Great analysis, as always. I personally would ding Spider-Woman a couple of points for theme, as her multi-aspect nature is not based on anything in the comics. But that multi-aspect gimmick is crucial to what makes her interesting and entertaining in this game.  And I find myself in complete agreement regarding Kang.<br/><br/>I haven't played Adam Warlock for a long time, but I remember that he doesn't want to play his milling cards (Cosmic Awareness and Karmic Blast) until he has his best upgrades and supports in play. In theory, he should be able to put together interesting card combos involving two or more aspects, but Marvel Champions doesn't seem to offer those kinds of synergies. The better card combos generally seem to be a hero ability or card plus an aspect card. So instead of trying for synergies, maybe it would be better to build a deck that is heavy on cheap upgrades, supports, and allies, in hopes of getting them all in play and then just racing through his deck to load up Soul World. Preparation cards might be especially useful. I haven't tried that, but did some obvious tuning like removing the cosmic entities (Eternity, Living Tribunal, etc.). That still leaves me with an awkward and random deck that I haven't felt like playing for a long time.<br/><br/>The other thing that I haven't tried yet with Adam Warlock is replacing one of the four standard aspects with 'Pool. It seems sub-optimal due to losing 25% of his Battle Mage ability, but maybe there could be better card combos that are possible. For example, maybe swap Protection with 'Pool. You could give Adam a Healing Factor and maybe 5 'Pool allies, and use Summoning Spell and Make the Call to keep those allies coming back. I might add two on to Adam Warlock for deckbuilding because it feels like there is more potential."

Do you prefer deck construction before play or deck building while playing. Does the theme matter? Superheroes vs Fantasy? I'll add that I actively dislike the Marvel franchise but the game is so good I own all of it. The theme kept me away from Marvel Champions for a long time, and I regret not getting into it sooner."

            "body": "Big fans of both games and own both.<br/><br/>If I could only keep one, I'd keep Aeon's End but it's extremely close. Essentially you need to decide if you want to build your decks before you play (or play precon) via deck construction, or have the deckbuilding be an integral part of the actual gameplay.<br/><br/>One other thing of note though, is that Aeon's End is a bit smoother to teach in my opinion, it has easier to understand rules and less keyword bloat/phase bloat compared with Marvel Champions (though it does have some as it's gotten more developed). But essentially buying cards to then use them forever is a pretty easy concept to understand so the 'decision space' for players is really \"I have x amount of buying power, what do I want to buy?\"... Marvel Champions calculations are a bit more complicated because you use cards to pay for other cards, and people often just want to play all of the stuff they have, in that way it can feel a bit restrictive to people that don't like that economic style.<br/><br/>Equally the enemy phase in Marvel Champions is a bit more complicated, as the villain activates against every player and then also each player gets one or more encounter cards (typically 1 but often effects give more) so it's like the villain has a really long turn. Aeon's End's activation line is far more simple and it draws a single card and doesn't really have phases like MC (or rather, has simpler ones).<br/><br/>I've tried both with multiple levels of gamers and Aeon's End just seems to be easier to follow for the vast majority of light-mid gamers; obviously more core gaming groups really won't have an issue with either."

            "body": "I really enjoy both.  They both have the great replayability due to the different heroes and villains that can be used along with the different market in AE.  I think the villain difference level is pretty similar but the hero differences are more pronounced in MC.<br/><br/>MC gets a LOT more play at my house because of game time and especially set up time difference.  AE has a VERY long set up time IMO.  That is a barrier for me in getting it to the table more than about once a month."

If you have experience with LOTR LCG and stuff like that, just note that this doesn’t come close to the amount of options and possibilities, even with just a couple cycles worth of cards<br/><br/>This is a very abbreviated, simplified deck construction experience. It works for a lot of people, obviously, but it depends how much you want to tinker. "

            "body": "I haven't seen mentions of player count (you mentioned surveying friends) but that would be a big difference.<br/><br/>Aeon's End is more or less 60-90 minutes at all player counts, it doesn't affect the game length that much. More players equals more discussions but from what I recall the game timer is the same.<br/>Marvel Champions's length is a linear function of player count. Depending on scenario, that's usually 30-60 minutes per player. So if you want to play a 4 player game, you are looking at easily double the play time of Aeon's End, in most cases more than that.<br/><br/>And I'll second that Aeon's End is a lot easier to explain than Marvel Champions, particularly if they've played a deckbuilding game before. For Marvel Champions, you'll spend a lot more time on forums on rules interactions and clarifications. It depends on players' aversion to just keep playing and making it up as they go or if they are rules lawyers."
