I don't think my post here is incorrect, it's just not answering the right question.<br/><br/><strike>The rules instruct you to keep losing buildings until you have enough people tokens to lose what you're supposed to. It's <i>after</i> that section that it says \"if you have to lose more people than you can, your moon colony has failed. The game is over.\"  I'd say that you have to lose all your buildings on your way to that loss state. <br/><br/>The intention seems pretty clear to me that the player triggering the end of the game has zero people left, and shouldn't have leftover people (via tokens <i>or</i> buildings) to potentially win over someone who paid their losses in full. You don't get to say \"I don't have that many to lose, so the game ends before I lose anything\". Though I do see how you could interpret the rules that way.</strike>"

This one wasn't even on my radar until he put the idea in my head.<br/><br/>There's a long backstory to this retheme project involving 3-4 different games, and 2-3 different theme topics, that is too weird and winding and convoluted for me to get into here. Suffice to say, this is where I've landed: this game, but in the retro-futuristic, overly optimistic world of Vault-Tec propaganda, with Vault Boy and other vault dwellers playing a starring role in the inevitable demise of their vaults, their air supplies, their resources, and ultimately, their lives.<br/><br/>First up, we need some Vault Overseer Player Boards, in the classic PiPBoy style. My thinking here was to use 4 cubes to keep track of actions, instead of the action tokens in the original game. Place the cube on the action you wish to take, then after performing the action, move the cube to its spot on the track.<br/><br/><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8884582\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F-um6wOzAsPVE4WkERbCUw__small/img/GZpEfLHw19g3mQn9rM4luHasujQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8884582.png\" border=0></a></div><br/><br/>Then I worked on the 20 Robot cards. Just an opportunity to have some fun with the Overseer typeface, the card image, and using <a href=\"https://www.semicolon.com/multideck/multideck.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Multideck</a> to embed inline images into the card effect text. Much better now that <a  href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/39311/rick-holzgrafe\"   >Rick Holzgrafe</a> has added the ability to adjust the size of the inline images.<br/><br/><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8884586\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/elXJl5abWiDQcfyKA6RKwA__small/img/VuOo_s4OKs8MZoZVeNlPXbLMk3E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8884586.png\" border=0></a></div><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8884588\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZMDfUr8rYAVD4lQnXAOGZg__small/img/P0qxXgVPp7PhuZz_eb6DyVF54_Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8884588.png\" border=0></a></div><div style='display:inline;'><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8884589\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aETy_SCGjkUr9DOQ1yIOZg__small/img/_erDyfC9eM__ul0QlK4VevtA17s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8884589.png\" border=0></a></div><br/><br/>The plan is to keep the art style clean and cartoonish, with brightly colored foreground characters and elements, with darker, more drab vault backgrounds.

You can even note RGG not complaining about those things either. And then can do similar research for Fallout mods. None of that amounts to any kind of legal protection for you though.<br/><br/>I'm the only one with rights to the long-out-of-print Gauntlet of Fools, not counting the art or specific rulebook text; if you want to make a retheme of that, again using none of the original art, well you have my permission.

The whole point of deep regrets is to manipulate the regret between players and also gain understanding what’s everyone holding.

Perhaps that is the case for this game and how Tom feels about it.<br/><br/>As a simple example: We tend to feel quite differently about a game that requires you to spend resources each round or lose points versus one that requites us to spend a number of resources each round to gain points. Same effect, completely different feel, but one might implement either one depending upon the setting (or as some say 'theme') of the game."

Of course map and goal are more accessible at 3p with maybe higher points as you might easy reach 3 end location ( but at 2p you can still do it) but a part of that, revive is not an auction game.  Say i enjoy even age of steam a 2p .

I've played mostly at 4p, but have multiple games at all counts.<br/><br/>Also very much looking forward to this one."

From the moment you see that cover art whispering “harmony with nature,” you know you’re in for a calm, satisfying experience.<br/><br/>When you sit down to play, you find a serene puzzle… until that perfect combo of salmon tokens lands on the board. You know it isn’t actually the optimal play for your wife, but somehow she snags that salmon first and you realize even indirect competition can sting. Ten seconds later the frustation disappears as you realize there’s always another tile waiting. The game is smart enough to steer you clear of truly dead-end draws, so you never feel hopelessly stuck.<br/><br/><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8885762\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2W10qcyIQSKmbk6_zeY78A__small/img/DcxNzWaRFpTq47PqvCZ5BIcJoMo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8885762.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><br/><br/>Components get top marks from the tarot-sized cards, the high quality habitat tiles to the chunky animal tokens.  My only nitpick? The insert is terrible. I still can’t figure out the “correct” way to pack it all away—strangely ironic for a game where everything else fits so perfectly.<br/><br/>The gameplay is every bit as satisfying as expected. Matching terrain types and placing animals feels intuitive, yet there’s enough depth in planning your cascades to keep you hooked for hours. It’s not going to replace your all-time favorite, but it’s the perfect Sunday-afternoon pick-up-and-play that never overstays its welcome.<br/><br/>What really surprised me, though, is the replayability. You’d think a family-oriented puzzle would go stale fast, but the ever-shifting scoring cards for each animal ensure you’re always chasing a fresh goal. No two games ever feel the same.<br/><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Presentation - 10<br/>Engagement - 7<br/>Gameplay - 9<br/>Value - 8<br/><br/>&gt; Final Score: 8.5 / 10<br/><br/><br/><div style=''><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/8885756\"><img src=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AAp-xREN-LX5vpo7JkTL-A__small/img/loud1RQprWxQy2s7U2g_zF4SLSg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8885756.jpg\" border=0></a></div><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Wrap-Up:<br/>Cascadia isn’t an earth-shattering epic, but it’s the ideal mood-maker—perfect for a rainy Sunday or dialing down the tension after a cut-throat session.

Sometimes shape matters, sometimes it doesn't. Salmon is already restricted in that the runs only count as long as each doesn't connect to more than 2 others.

The example shows a group of 2 Hawks, 3 Elk, 3 Foxes, and 6 Bears. According to the chart on the card, the Hawks will score 3 points for having a group size of \"2\", while the other three groups will score 5 points each for having a group size of \"3+\". Note that the group of 6 Bears falls into the category of \"group size of 3+ scores 5 Points\" so the Bears will only score 5 points even though there are 6 of them in the group.<br/><br/>As noted in a previous reply above, if the Bears had been separated into two different non-adjacent groups of 3 Bears each, then *both* of those groups would have scored 5 points each.<br/><br/>The correct answer is 18.<br/><br/>Cheers!"

However I'm setting up the base game to play it with my wife and I wanted to use the oversized cards if even possible to use them with the basic board. I couldn't figure out how to place the critter and construction cards onto the meadow. It doesn't look right if I just place them like the og cards 😅.<br/><br/>So is there also a bigger main board or any other way to use the oversized cards properly in the game? Or are they just collectables and \"nice to have\" goodies?"

You can find the original post <a href=\"https://www.lautapeliopas.fi/peliarvostelut/faraway/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">here</a>. I'm planning on translating my review to English but until I've done that, please enjoy this gibberish that is known as the Finnish language! ...or just use Google translator.<br/><br/>******<br/><br/><b>Faraway</b><br/><br/><i>Pelaajat tutkivat mystistä Alulan maanosaa, selvittävät sen salaisuuksia sekä keräävät mainetta tässä näpsäkässä ja kekseliäässä korttipelissä.</i><br/><br/>Sumujen meren takaa löytyy mystinen Alulan maanosa, jota 2-6 pelaajaa lähtee tutkimaan <i>Farawayssa</i>. Pelin sääntövihkossa on avattu pelin maailman taustatarinaa useamman sivun verran, vaan eipä pelaajien tarvitse sillä juuri päätään vaivata. <i>Farawayssa</i> nimittäin keskiössä ovat värikkäät, neliskanttiset aluekortit, niiden värit ja niissä näkyvät symbolit sekä järjestys, jossa pelaaja pelaa kortteja omalle tutkimusmatkalleen. Taustatarinalla tässä ei ole pelillisesti juuri ollenkaan merkitystä.<br/><br/>Pelin suunnittelijoiden <b><a  href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/113774/johannes-goupy\"   >Johannes Goupyn</a></b> ja <b><a  href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/60151/corentin-lebrat\"   >Corentin Lebratin</a></b> aiemmat tuotokset eivät ole minulle erityisen tuttuja, poislukien <i>Lebratin</i> osasuunnittelema <a  href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/264055/draftosaurus\"   >Draftosaurus</a>, joten <i>Faraway</i> on siinä mielessä kiehtova peli, että minulla ei ole verrokkikokemusta muista sen suunnittelijoiden peleistä. Joka tapauksessa <i>Faraway</i> osoittautuu omanlaisekseen moninpelipasianssiksi, jossa pelaajien välinen vuorovaikutus on hyvin vähäistä.<br/><br/><b>Mars matkaan!</b><br/><br/><i>Farawayssa</i> pelaajat pelaavat eteensä pöydälle kahdeksan korttia vasemmalta oikealta: nämä kortit kuvaavat kunkin pelaajan tutkimusmatkaa Alulan mantereella. Pelin alussa kukin pelaaja saa kolme korttia käteensä ja pelialueelle käännetään pakasta pelaajien lukumäärää vastaava määrä aluekortteja plus yksi.<br/><br/>Kortit on täytetty erilaisilla symboleilla, joilla on oma merkityksensä. Korteista löytyy ainakin väri (ja kuvio helpottamaan värisokeita pelaajia) ja jokin numero vasemmasta yläkulmasta. Värillä on lähinnä merkitystä joidenkin korttien pisteytykseen, kun taas numero puolestaan kuvastaa tarinallisesti tutkimusmatkan kestoa, mutta pelillisesti sillä on osittain vaikutusta vuorojärjestykseen sekä mahdollisten pyhäkköjen löytymiseen. Näistä kerron tarkemmin myöhemmin tässä arvostelussa. Lisäksi korteista voi löytyä erilaisia resurssisymboleita (kivet, kimairat ja ohdakkeet), vihjemerkkejä (karttakuvat) sekä pisteytyksiä.<br/><br/>Kullakin kierroksella pelaajat valitsevat käsikorteistaan yhden aluekortin ja pelaavat sen eteensä kuvapuoli alaspäin. Kun kaikki pelaajat ovat valinneet korttinsa, ne käännetään kuvapuoli ylöspäin, minkä jälkeen kierroksen pieninumeroisimman kortin pelannut pelaaja valitsee yhden pelialueen keskellä tarjolla olevista aluekorteista käteensä ja sitten toisiksi pienimmän kortin pelannut pelaaja ja niin edelleen. Kunhan kaikki pelaajat ovat valinneet uuden kortin käteensä, ylimääräinen kortti poistetaan pelistä ja pakasta käännetään uudet kortit pelialueen keskelle. Sitten pelataan uusi kierros samalla tavalla ja tätä jatketaan, kunnes pelaajat ovat pelanneet eteensä kahdeksan korttia.<br/><br/><b>Oikotie, oikotie, se uuteen pyhäkköön vie</b><br/><br/>Toisesta kierroksesta alkaen peliin tulee mukaan pieni lisä: pyhäköt. Aina kun pelaaja pelaa tutkimusmatkalleen aluekortin, jonka numero on isompi kuin hänen edellisessä kortissaan, pelaaja löytää pyhäkön eli nostaa erillisestä pyhäkkökorttipakasta kortin ja lisää sen oman tutkimusmatkansa yläpuolelle. Pyhäkkökortit ovat eräänlaisia ekstra- tai lisäkortteja, jotka voivat antaa pelaajalle lisäpisteytyksiä ja -resursseja tai muita hyötyjä.  <br/><br/>Pyhäkkökortit linkittyvät korttien numeroiden lisäksi niissä näkyviin vihjeisiin: nostaessaan pyhäkkökortteja pelaaja saa nostaa pyhäkkökorttipakasta yhden kortin sekä lisäksi yhden pyhäkkökortin jokaista tutkimusmatkallaan näkyvää vihjettä kohden. Nostetuista korteista pelaaja saa lisätä kuitenkin vain yhden pyhäkön tutkimusmatkansa yläpuolelle, mutta mitä enemmän pelaajalla on valinnanvaraa, sitä todennäköisimmin hän saa pyhäkön, joka hyödyttää häntä eniten.<br/><br/><b>Sinne ja takaisin - pisteillä tai ilman</b><br/><br/>Jos <i>Farawayssa</i> on jo tähän mennessä riittänyt pohdittavaa, niin erityisen maukkaan lisäsäväyksen antaa pelin pisteytys, jossa piileekin <i>Farawayn </i>kiehtovuus. Pelin lopussa pelaaja “palaa” rakentamaansa reittiä takaisin ja korteista saatavat pisteet lasketaan oikealta vasemmalle eli vastakkaisessa järjestyksessä kuin missä kortit pelattiin. Jotta paluumatka(kaan) ei olisi liian yksinkertainen, sisältyy siihenkin lisämauste: ennen paluumatkaa pelaajat kääntävät pelaamansa aluekortit ylösalaisin ja paluumatkalla kortit paljastetaan yksi kerrallaan oikealta vasemmalle. <br/><br/>Pelaaja saa pisteitä aluekorteista sen mukaan, miten on onnistunut täyttämään korttien ehdot niillä korteilla, jotka ovat näkyvillä korttia pisteyttäessä. Rakentaessaan tutkimusmatkaansa pelaajan pitää siis miettiä aluekorttiensa järjestystä päinvastaisessa järjestyksessä kuin missä pelaa ne maksimoidakseen pisteensä! Rakennusvaiheeseen sisältyy aimo annos pähkäiltävää myös sen puolesta, että pelaajien keräämät pyhäköt jäävät näkyville koko paluumatkan ajaksi - niitä ei käännetä ympäri missään vaiheessa. Siten <i>Faraway</i> tarjoilee oikein maukkaan pohdintahetken, kun rakennusvaiheessa pitää pohtia, pyrkiikö maksimoimaan pyhäkkökorttien määrään (ja samalla mahdollisesti riskeeraamaan tilanteensa, jos pyhäkkökorteissa ei olekaan toivottuja merkkejä) vai onko parempi pelata jokin “varmempi” aluekortti omalle tutkimusmatkalle.<br/><br/><i>Faraway</i> ei kuitenkaan muutu missään vaiheessa liian monimutkaiseksi tai haastavaksi - tähän vaikuttanee tiukaksi rajattu määrä käsikortteja, jolloin vaihtoehtoja ei ole tuhottomasti. Säännöt ovat myös loppujen lopuksi melko simppelit ja suoraviivaiset, ja pelin haastavuus tuleekin ennemmin siitä, että pelaajien pitää käytännössä nyrjäyttää aivonsa oikeaan asentoon. Ainakin minulla pari ensimmäistä pelikertaa meni täysin penkin alle, kun aivoni kieltäytyivät tajuamasta korttien pisteytystä päinvastaisessa järjestyksessä.<br/><br/><b>Näkymät ovat kauniit ja matkakin on näyttävä</b><br/><br/>Kuten aivan arvostelun alussa mainitsin, <i>Faraway</i> on käytännössä moninpelipasianssi: pelaajien välillä ei juurikaan ole vuorovaikutusta, eivätkä pelaajat esimerkiksi kilpaile toisiaan vastaan mistään enemmistöstä. Pelaajien välinen vuorovaikutus syntyy lähinnä välillisesti siitä, jos jokin toinen pelaaja sattuu valitsemaan toisen pelaajan haluaman kortin, jossa olisi tämän tarvitsema resurssi. Tietoinen kiusanteko on kuitenkin <i>Farawayssa</i> hyvin harvinaista, ja siten <i>Faraway</i> on melko harmiton peli. <br/><br/>Henkilökohtaisesti nautin vuorovaikutuksellisemmista peleistä enemmän, mutta <i>Farawayn</i> kaltaisessa pelissä vuorovaikutusta ei lopulta aivan mahdottomasti edes kaipaa. Pelissä on mukavasti pohdittavaa ja pelin luonteeseen sopii hyvin rauha rakentaa omaa tutkimusmatkaansa ilman, että muut pelaajat parhaansa mukaan koittaisivat häiritä sitä. <br/><br/>Korttituurilla on eittämättä oma vaikutuksena pelissä menestymiseen, sillä joskus sopivia tai “oikeita” kortteja ei vain ilmesty, jolloin esimerkiksi tiettyjä resursseja ei vain meinaa saada riittävästi korttien ehtojen täyttymiseksi. Siten pelaajien pistetulokset voivat vaihdella paljonkin, myös samalla pelaajalla eri pelikertojen välillä. <i>Farawayssa</i> se ei kuitenkaan ole ongelma, sillä sen pelaa varsin nopeasti: pelikerrat ovat kestäneet pääsääntöisesti 20-30 minuuttia pelaajamäärästä riippumatta, joten ajallisesti ei tule suurta menetystä, vaikka yksi pelikerta menisikin penkin alle.<br/><br/><i>Farawayn</i> kuvitus on kaunista ja kortteja katsellessa olo on kuin pienenä karkkikaupassa. Korteissa on kuvattuna Alulan hahmoja ja paikkoja, mikä tavallaan tukee teemaa, mutta ei tätä silti tule teeman vuoksi pelattua. Teemaa nyt noin muutenkaan ei juuri tule mietittyä pelin aikana, vaan huomio keskittyy lähinnä korttien numeroihin ja symboleihin. Tästä huolimatta pöydälle levitettyä Farawayta on mukavaa katsella, mikä varmasti vetoaa moneen muuhunkin kuin ainoastaan allekirjoittaneeseen.<br/><br/><b>Maanalaiset kansat: lisäosalla lisää kortteja</b><br/><br/><i>Farawaylle</i> on julkaistu jo myös lisäosa, <b><a  href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/425029/faraway-people-from-below\"   >People From Below</a></b>, joka tuo peliin lisää kortteja. Kokonaisuutena lisäosa on varsin pieni, sillä siinä tulee vain yhdeksän uutta aluekorttia ja kahdeksan uutta pyhäkkökorttia. Uudet kortit mahdollistavat <i>Farawayn</i> pelaamisen jopa seitsemällä pelaajalla sekä esittelevät muutamia uusia pisteytyksiä, kun peliin lisätään harmaat aluekortit.<br/><br/>Omistan myös lisäosan, mutta sen kanssa en ole ehtinyt peliä vielä pelaamaan. Siten en pysty tarkemmin arvioimaan lisäosan merkityksellisyyttä, mutta näin etukäteistuntumalla sanoisin, että lisäpisteytykset ja uudet kortit noin ylipäätänsä ovat varmasti hyvä lisä <i>Farawayhin</i>.<br/>"

With more players it does feel like there’s a bit less luck, as there are more cards to choose from every turn, especially if you get to play early in the round, so a higher chance of getting what you are planning/hoping for.<br/>+ The tension that lies in hoping to draw what you need in those last cards is always fun<br/>+ As I was originally taught this game, I only saw the rulebook after I had already played it several times. I was positively surprised to find a quite long description of the theme, regarding the lands you walk through, the inhabitants and the wildlife. The theme doesn’t really shine through, I’m sorry to say, but I do appreciate the effort that was put into creating a bit of theme for the game. <br/><br/><b>End conclusion (well, for now):</b><br/>I enjoyed my plays of this, and I’ll happily play this when somebody suggests it, but I don’t feel a need to own this myself.

Purely based on complexity and depth, I think 2.5-ish sounds right to me.<br/>But this does not really take into account the whole social interaction part, which is hard to include in the weight.<br/>But it’s always possible to find some exceptions to try to disprove a general rule.<br/><br/>Just because BGG doesn’t have a proper definition doesn’t mean that Weight is not well defined. There are plenty of places where Weight is well described, here for instance: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://chitsandgiggles.games/understanding-board-game-weights\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://chitsandgiggles.games/understanding-board-game-weigh...</a><br/>And in general, my experience is that the voice of the masses work pretty well on BGG, in that the average weight rating tends to give a pretty a good indication of what to expect. (Of course this does not work with games that only have received a small number of weight votes), while also showing that individual opinions will vary. <br/>What I’m saying is that my personal opinion - or that of the two people arguing that this game is much deeper, or of the couple of people that have commented that they agree with me - probably bears less weight than that of the BGG masses. In general, they give a pretty decent indication of weight via the BGG weight rating.<br/>But sure, if you don’t trust the BGG community to give you a proper indication of weight, then the weight rating becomes useless and takes away the one semi-neutral “fact” to use in a discussion between two people over whether a game is deep or not.<br/>Than we can only settle on agreeing to disagree."

Heck, Betrayal at the House on the Hill has a higher weight than Hive, and that's purely a game of rolling dice and pulling cards and seeing what happens.<br/><br/>There's been some interesting analysis and discussion about separating out the two axes over the years.

Prior to building, the westernmost<br/>city must have one, and only one, locomotive in the hex; Chicago,<br/>as usual, may hold any number. Which cities are westernmost is<br/>determined the moment the first Yellow locomotive would be<br/>placed on the game board.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Here is the text from the Winsome Games version (i.e. Rail USA): <br/><font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>This railroad must start in one [of] the three westernmost cities that has a railroad and only one railroad in the hex, or Chicago. Which cities are westernmost is judged at the moment the first yellow cube is placed.</i></div></div></font><br/>There have been two helpful threads clarifying some questions about these rules, <a  href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2477430/question-about-starting-the-yellow-railroad\"   >here</a>and  <a  href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2570484/yellow-railway-start-location-again\"   >here</a>.  <br/><br/>But as I read things, we still lack an official ruling about the special case in which Chicago has exactly one train in it and moreover, Chicago is one of \"the three westernmost cities that has a railroad and only one railroad in the hex.\" How do we read the rule in that case? In particular, is it...<br/><br/><img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/star_yellow.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /> <b>The stricter interpretation</b>: Your choices = [Chicago, westernmost 1-railroad city A, westernmost 1-railroad city B] OR [Chicago] -- so, just three cities to choose from.<br/><br/><img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/star_yellow.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /> <b>The looser interpretation</b>: Your choices = [westernmost 1-railroad non-Chicago city A, westernmost 1-railroad non-Chicago city B, westernmost 1-railroad non-Chicago city C] OR [Chicago] <br/><br/>With the looser interpretation, a player has four cities to choose from for the starting position of the Yellow Railroad. With the stricter interpretation, a player can sometimes have just three cities to choose from, namely, in the special case where Chicago itself is one of \"the three westernmost cities that has a railroad and only one railroad in the hex.\"<br/><br/>It's not clear to me what the best interpretation is. I agree the stricter interpretation is the more literal interpretation. But I also find it easy to imagine that the designer/publisher always intended for there to be four choices of starting city and just didn't notice the possibility of a strictly literal interpretation. <br/><br/>Maybe we will get an official ruling on this. But in the mean time, below is a poll to take. (<i>Side note</i>: for purposes of this poll, let's ignore a case in which more than three cities are tied for \"westernmost.\")<br/><br/>[poll=2090314]<br/>If you choose \"something else,\" please let us know in a comment what that something else is."

I have not played yet, but want to make sure I know what to do if it comes up.<br/><br/>From what I understand, the 12/8 bonus is determined when the connection is made. That makes sense if one track is heading east from a purple city and another is heading west.<br/><br/>However, what happens if there is a multi-railway route that started in the east and heads west. Then eventually, after multiple connections reaches a purple city. At the time the transcontinental is completed, it is due to a western extension, not a new connection. If there are 3 railways on the route, and one connection is in a city while the other is in a rural hex, how do you determine the bonus? In this case, would it be the westernmost connection? Or do you have to track the timestamp of every railway connection in case it eventually heads west and forms a transcontinental?"

The more there are, the more money you earn when selling that fruit!<br/><br/>🫐With your earnings, you’ll begin constructing a building. Each guild offers different types of structures, all built in 3 sequential levels. As you progress, you may unlock instant bonuses, temporary abilities, and valuable scoring conditions. Completing all 3 levels not only earns you points but also grants you banners, which play a key role in ending the game.
