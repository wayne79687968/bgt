Or does he only pick up the ones on the cards he's passed over?<br/>b) Concerning the pose effect “pass over a card of your choice while moving without applying the passing effects”, if there are rabbit meeples on this card, do I pick them up and put them in my domain? <br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Translated with DeepL.com (free version)"

Yes, you always pick up the meeple bunnies when passing onto or arriving on a card — even if it’s the one you just placed. However, the passing effect from your own arrival card is not triggered.<br/><br/>B. You don’t collect meeple bunnies or trigger passing effects from cards you jumped over.<br/><br/>Hope that clears things up!"

It's basically a passion play put on by the survivors/travelers in their new home, retelling the story on St. Leibowitz Day. My dream was to put it on in a church setting with the cast seated amongst the congregation and coming on stage to tell their part of the story.

While not mechanically integrated, the theme is present and relevant, specifically in the campaign story. It’s just overall a really solid mid-weight, smooth euro.<br/><br/>There is honestly quite a lot going on in this game, so I’m not going to cover too much in terms of how to play or the nitty gritty of the mechanics. Some will be mentioned in my thoughts, but if you’re interested in a game play overview, this is not the review you’re looking for.<br/><br/>First off, let me just say that the setup for this game is rather lengthy. There are a lot of little bits and pieces including wooden components, tiles, cards, etc. that all require some TLC to get the game going. That said, the componentry is nice, and everything fits well back into the box which is always a positive. The artwork is also gorgeous, especially the image on the back of the board.<br/><br/>The rulebook for this game is fantastic, in my opinion. Not only are the explanations of the game done well, but the order of the rulebook integrates with the flow of the game expertly. That first game, you feel like you can sort of following along with the descriptions and play your first turn(s) simultaneously. The symbol reference pages are also phenomenal; there was not one symbol or tile or card that I came across that wasn’t described in detail.<br/><br/>While I only played it solo, I would be interested in testing it in a multiplayer setting. I feel like a four-player game would be quite lengthy, but the player interaction on the main board would obviously be more intriguing when not playing solo. There are also some tribes that have abilities more well suited to a multiplayer setting that I would like to experiment with.<br/><br/>Before I get into what I really enjoy and appreciate about this game, I do want to point out a few small, potential flaws. I always value the inclusion of player aids and reference cards, but these ones are a little weak. I assume they were trying to keep text on them minimal, which I do like, but I still felt like I needed to reference the rulebook at quite a few stages, especially during hibernation. By personal preference, I also am not a huge fan of the beat your own score system for the solo mode. I actually find the design of the solo mode to be lovely but playing to just try to beat any previous scores/reach a certain level in the score chart is a little irritating. From my limited board game design knowledge, it seems like creating and implementing scenarios and/or achievements for the solo game would be an easy addition. Also, I think partly due to this, the game got rather repetitive for me after eight (ish) plays. I’d likely feel different if there was variation in player count, but always just trying to maximize points wasn’t super motivating.<br/><br/>Now on to my favorite parts! As most people who have read at least one of our reviews knows, I adore a good campaign, especially when it can be played solo. The unlockable components and content during the campaign for Revive was great. It’s a five chapter campaign, and after the first game, additional elements, content, and rules get introduced that enhance the game play and strategic nature of the game. I also admire how tense and tight the solo game gets towards the end: with the action cube moving up the track when playing cards and hibernating, it’s tough to balance the action selection and resource management with trying to gain points. I always felt I needed one or two more turns to really optimize my game, but I enjoyed that.<br/><br/>One other addition that I greatly appreciate is that the unique tribes do truly play differently, have their own abilities, and their boards display special technologies (and maybe other powers that could get unlocked during the campaign…). Each tribe board is also double sided to increase that variation. The back side (the moon side) increases the variety of actions, bonuses, and technologies which are really impressive and overall practical in terms of replayability.<br/><br/>My absolute favorite design choice in this game is the interconnectedness between the tech tracks on the player boards and the actions and goals for the game. It’s challenging to describe without just explaining the whole game, but even though there are a lot of moving parts, action options, components, etc., everything has its place and ties in or relates to some other important aspect of the game (and maybe even the theme). It’s truly brilliant and it creates such a satisfying puzzle to try to decipher. It’s a solid combo-making game where one thing lets you do another thing which leads to two more things.<br/><br/>For me, as I’ve only played it solo, this game isn’t perfect, but it is a really fun and cleverly designed board game. There are a lot of unique elements, some thematic integration, and just really cool, puzzly game play with neat reliability on other aspects of the game. The ultimate creation? A piece of art that is cohesive, strategically deep, and has a wonderful table presence. What more could you ask for!? Unless, of course, we are talking about the win conditions related to the solo mode…"

Could these effects apply when we have an Innovation Department bonuses?<br/><br/>I think in both cases the answer should be no, because in both cases the wording says that the effect of factory is an action modifier (action on the main board, not the action from the other effects). But in this case, we should always think about not buying factories with these anti-synergy effects (in opposite to how it usually works in other games).<br/><br/>Best regards.<br/><br/>"

            "body": "Sorry for this getting long and maybe a bit outside of the scope of your original question, but it all ties in with the new additions to the game. <br/>I'd say it depends on what you compare it to. In comparison to og Nippon, I would argue that one might call this game 'combotastic' or 'abundant', but in comparison to other games; maybe not so much. <br/>l'll just start by saying that I've only played og Nippon a handful of times, all within this year except an old play on BGA a few years back, so I'm in no way an expert.<br/>But I've followed the campaign as I like the game and wanted to see what this new version brought to the table. And I do share a lot of the 'concerns' that's been voiced so far. My two main concerns with the new version was that it's become too 'abundant' in resources and leans more into multiplayer solitaire. <br/><br/>I think Board gaming ramblings did a good comparison in their video, and they addressed the fact that vp multipliers are now on your own board instead of in a common pool, which I am not really a fan of. The race to grab the high multipliers is completely gone and you can consolidate at your own leisure knowing your high scoring tokens are still there waiting for you to decide what to do with them, making you able to play it a bit more safe and not have to chicken race others in grabbing the x5s or x4s. <br/>Also the new department makes me feel like players will focus more on what they need themselves in terms of bonuses, rather than in what colour worker other players are focusing on and what might be 'left alone' for you to consolidate for cheap (or for others to draft just to make it more expensive for you, there's that aspect as well).<br/>When I watched the 2p playthrough from Before you play I felt they had so many resources all the time and albeit tight, some of it felt not so tight anymore.

I do realize I might have played thinking like in og Nippon, and upon playing Zaibatsu more I reckon you'd get a better feel for when to take what resources as to not take more resources than you need, but even so the game just 'gives you resources' at times that you then have to do something with (as mentioned above when going up the different tracks etc). <br/><br/>A bit of a side step from your original question, but in a way it ties in with combotasticness and abundance.

I don't find the new game to be bad per se, if you like to do your own thing (not having to race for scoring multipliers) and like having enough resources to not feel too restricted, then the new version I'd say is still a good game, but for me personally and for the reasons I like Nippon, I feel like the new version is not for me.

In comparison to og Nippon, I would argue that one might call this game 'combotastic' or 'abundant', but in comparison to other games; maybe not so much. <br/>l'll just start by saying that I've only played og Nippon a handful of times, all within this year except an old play on BGA a few years back, so I'm in no way an expert.<br/>But I've followed the campaign as I like the game and wanted to see what this new version brought to the table. And I do share a lot of the 'concerns' that's been voiced so far. My two main concerns with the new version was that it's become too 'abundant' in resources and leans more into multiplayer solitaire. <br/><br/>I think Board gaming ramblings did a good comparison in their video, and they addressed the fact that vp multipliers are now on your own board instead of in a common pool, which I am not really a fan of. The race to grab the high multipliers is completely gone and you can consolidate at your own leisure knowing your high scoring tokens are still there waiting for you to decide what to do with them, making you able to play it a bit more safe and not have to chicken race others in grabbing the x5s or x4s. <br/>Also the new department makes me feel like players will focus more on what they need themselves in terms of bonuses, rather than in what colour worker other players are focusing on and what might be 'left alone' for you to consolidate for cheap (or for others to draft just to make it more expensive for you, there's that aspect as well).<br/>When I watched the 2p playthrough from Before you play I felt they had so many resources all the time and albeit tight, some of it felt not so tight anymore. But maybe they're just good at the game or good at resource management in general?<br/><br/>So I tried the solo mode on TTS.

It does have the classic euro \"move forward this track, reach the icon, get more resources\", but I think it's important to point out that those bonuses are never more actions. The only time you would get a new action is when a factory has a bonus that lets you either do another action on build or during production, which is not really that often. It's not like in Tiletum when someone is chaining 4 different actions into one turn and you wait 20 minutes for that one person to do their thing, actions in this game are rather quick and there is no easy way to get more actions per turn.<br/><br/>The thing that I don't like is expert workers, this current iteration feels a bit pointless to me, it's not an interesting mechanic and theme-wise it just doesn't make sense."

A big chunk of your points come from it, and I didn't mention it since the topic was changes/additions. It is still important to focus on area control and getting influence out on the board, and since I played solo I honestly can't say much about how that would work with human opponents because I felt the bot was way more aggressive with it and put them out a lot easier than a human player would. I think my main focus when trying the solo mode was trying out what was different, and come to terms with how I felt about those differences. The area control is important and I reckon still interactive, but it's how you get there that feels more mps for me, if that makes sense 🙂 not trying to sway you to keep your pledge, but as mentioned I focused more on the differences in my analysis and agree that there is still interaction, just not 'as much' imo. <br/>"

If you manage things well you should never theoretically be short of resources. Does that make the game less engaging? Not in my experience.

I have tried the new solo mode once and I felt like I was constantly short on something. You really have to plan ahead. If you want to do something you have to figure out how to get the resources you need. There's no action to just get the resource you want right away. Coal I think was the hardest one, I always wished I had more. Since you can't keep your coal or money, they will always be tight. When you do the Local Markets action you can get loads of a single resource. You need to constantly think ahead and plan multiple steps forward.<br/>"

The icon for \"place 1 outpost, paying any related costs\" has a black arrow about it. The outpost icon without the arrow appears in the senate and also on a pink tile.
